first of all , thank you all for coming to the try - outs : we are very happy so many students love football and prefer it as their sport . second of all , " and here lily had to insert a small lie out of courtesy , " it was extremely hard for us to select our four people as you were all so gifted . " here , lily gr ##oped for words , as her inspiration of flat ##tery got dry . " but . . . ? " a boy inter ##jected raising his brows and widening his eyes .	him and in a minute dissent and di ##sr ##es ##pe ##ct were all over the room , flooding all lily had achieved so far . she , however , was too young in the feeling of ecstasy from being adored to give up her status so soon . she was still curious to discover new ways of managing awkward situations and that was a perfect case for that . the boy was familiar to lily , his name was arthur coil and he was second - year as her , only he was in the house of stars . arthur was a peculiar boy . last year she knew him to be part of the theatre group , where phillip somme ##r ##ville also took part . lily remembered arthur was very powerful as an actor , at least she was overwhelmed by his performance in the school play at the end of the year . right now , she could not remember the play ' s title , but he was amazing . he had beautiful dark face , green eyes and dark - blond hair . tall and slim , but unfortunately no gift for football . lily almost expected his participation at the try - outs was a mere role for the theatre this year , she never took him for serious . and here he was , questioning lily ' s authority , trying to pull a joke on her words and her efforts to be polite and efficient . lily smiles sweetly and added , " but . . . we only needed four players and we made sure we pick the exact four ones . antony was amazing at the goal . sydney and oliver stunned us . it could be the fact that twin - brothers often have time to practice together , but that ' s just better . we don ' t consider that cheating , if you are curious . " lily felt she was getting malicious , but obviously peaceful talks were not always the best option . she noticed that arthur coil " coiled " in his place and turned pale . " we are doing our best for equality of representation , as we would like to have all houses and the two sexes equally represented in the team , yet . . . " she paused and looked at	0
think i ' ve done the same thing . i have bits and pieces of memories that i ' m not sure are the whole truth . " she looked thoughtful as she absently rubbed her thumb across the back of his hand . " i probably need to talk to my parents , see if i can make sense of those snatch ##es of memory . " " megan , katie thinks we only came out to see blue , but i had another reason . " " oh ? what ? " " i need to know who bought the farm . i was going to go to the courthouse to see if the records had been filed yet , but i ' m hoping you can tell me . " she looked a little uncomfortable at that thought . " why ? " " because i want to see if i can buy it back . " that was the last thing megan expected him to say . would he get mad when he found out she owned part of his inheritance ? of course , she ' d sell it back to him if he asked her to , but she hoped … . " why do you want to buy it ? are you going to keep it in trust for katie ? " she was a little taken aback by the earnest look on his face . " no . i want to live here . i want katie to grow up here . i want to be a part of the community . i want to come home . " " oh . " tears , hot and thick , burned the back of her eyes . " are you sure ? if you ' re not , you ' ll break her heart again . " " oh , yeah . i ' m sure . this is where we belong . i don ' t think i want to farm the land , but i ' d like to keep a few of the cows , and i ' d like to get blue back for katie . would you please tell me who owns it now ? " megan scooted her chair back	" come with me . there ' s something you need to see . " * * * she led him out the back door and he looked around . where an old metal storage shed had stood , there was a long , low building made of wood . four doors opened into fence ##d yards . another fence ran around the back of the pens . it took him a minute to realize what it was . " dog pens ? " she bit her lip and nodded . realization dawned and he turned to face her . " you bought it , didn ' t you ? did you build all this by yourself ? " " no , jake helped me .	0
onto anne ' s tree - lined street . the sun was little more than a spec ##k on the horizon . shadows covered the street and yards , and a shiver of nerves chased up her spine . did she really want to risk running into max in the dark ? what if he was lurking in the dark shadows cast by the street light ' s vain attempt to shine through the trees ? and who would take care of brandy if anything happened to her ? no one , that ' s who . anne was brandy ' s designated legal guardian if anything happened to maddie . she ' d never thought to name an alternate if the un ##thi ##nka ##ble happened and both she and anne were killed . she made a mental note to correct that oversight as soon as possible and pulled into anne ' s driveway , looking around before she opened the car door . all was ee ##rily quiet and still . she tried to shake off the fore ##bo ##ding that stole over her . you ' re being silly . nothing is wrong . anne just forgot her court date or something . she wouldn ' t have left town without letting you know where she was going , no matter how scared she was . the house looked empty . anne ' s car wasn ' t in the driveway , but she might have parked it in the garage if she was sp ##ook ##ed . maddie grabbed a flashlight from the glove box and stepped out of the car , slamming the door hard enough to announce her presence . no one came outside to see who had come to visit . no one peeked through the curtains . no dogs barked a warning . she stepped onto the wide front porch and cupped her hands around her eyes , trying in vain to see through the sheer curtains covering the bay window . there was no sound of a television or radio , no footsteps echoing from within the house . no sign of life . maddie opened the screen and knocked on the door , hard enough to bruise her knuckles . she waited , and waited . no one answered . she knocked again , then a third time . feeling like a too - stupid - to - live character in a b movie , she tried the door ##k ##nob - - and breathed a sigh of relief when she discovered it was locked . so that was that .	all she could do was wait until she called again . as maddie rounded the front of her vehicle , she glanced toward the backyard . a flash of white in the trees drew her closer . she really didn ' t want to go back there . but what if anne was in trouble ? she couldn ' t just walk away and leave her friend .	0

“ look , here are your new friends now . ” she indicated and he looked up to see hundreds of men reach the ridge where he was standing . as they stood there more of the creatures joined them on the ridge and one in particular caught his eye . a female was standing beside one of the men on the ridge and as he watched , they both looked into each others eyes and a similar moment passed between them . a moment vincent shared with one of the creatures himself , maybe even that same female . he was humble ##d beyond belief at the real ##isation that so many were willing and ready to help him , humans and animals alike . these men knew nothing about him yet here they were coming to save his life . and these creatures whose world he shared rep ##aid the simplest of kindness ##es on his part by helping him defeat this huge evil . he was greatly moved as sy ##ra took his hand and once again the scene changed .	like a rather sparsely furnished hotel room . discarded clothes on the bed revealed that the room was occupied by a woman . the sound of water came to his ears and he automatically looked towards the open door to his left . he went to look and saw a small bathroom . a woman was in the shower and he automatically looked away , not wanting to int ##rud ##e on her naked ##ness . sy ##ra held his hand firmly and urged him . “ do not fear vincent , go on in . ” he looked at sy ##ra , who nodded encouraging ##ly and he entered slowly , feeling like a vo ##ye ##ur as he saw the young woman standing in the shower . she was beautiful with long dark curly hair and a dragon tattoo on her back . as she turned around to face him he was shocked to see the lil ##ean star on her chest and he gaped at sy ##ra , who smiled gently . “ she carries the star vincent , but she is not lil ##ean . it was given to her as a gift from the ancient ones who made a choosing at the same time as the prophecy came to them . they chose her to be the one to aid you in your great task and she accepted their gift willingly and proudly . she has suffered greatly vincent and is still suffering due to giving you aid . look . ” as he watched he noticed the woman was weeping . her gentle tears turned to huge sobs that shook her body as she slumped down in the shower . he crouched down and sy ##ra put a hand on his shoulder . “ she weep ##s for you vincent . she weep ##s for your suffering but not her own and her only thought is of your safety	0

ll die anyway , and so will your son , for killing my sister . ” she aimed directly for his throat , trying to trans ##mute into the blade her full chi and all of her hatred for li ' s crimes . the blade cut the air sound ##lessly , and flame ' s anger burned as she saw nothing but a murderer , and the father of a murderer , before her . li , however , was not as tired as he seemed , and batted the blade aside . his rippled steel — the very one that had murdered her ma — shone like water as it cut for her side . flame moved her sword outward ##s , twisting away as she did so , but li ' s hate ##ful blade returned and dove for her foot . flame jumped , but li had struck something . while returning the blow , flame felt like she had stepped in a puddle of water . sudden pain told her it wasn ' t . the sword dove for her throat with a ru ##ff ##ling of the prefect ' s dark robes , and flame instinctively knew that she could not raise her sword in time . so she kicked his feet out instead . li went down in a crunch , and flame clamped her good foot down on his blade , re ##lie ##ving him of his sword . she spilled the remainder of the wine on him when she knocked the jug over with her foot . the wine covered a good half of his front ; the rest soaked the straw , and a rusty red formed where it soaked into the ground . flame saw it clearly , in the moonlight , as she pressed her sword at his throat . despite all this , li laughed . flame wondered if he had lost his wits with his chance at victory . “ i ' ll tell you what xiang taught you in error , ” li said , eyes gleaming unnatural ##ly . even di ##sar ##med , he still attacked , with	“ i don ' t want to know , ” flame told him . “ i just want to avenge family lia ##n . ” she prepared to twist her sword into li ' s throat . “ it was mercy . ” he smiled ironically . flame opened her mouth to argue that mercy wasn ' t wrong , but a sound at the door stopped her . the doorway was suddenly packed with li ' s guard . had they been there all along ? while she glanced , her blade dropped slightly . li had pushed her sword away with one hand , and was reaching with the other for her sword arm . un ##hes ##itating ##ly , flame slashed him aside , even as the first man entered with a yell . it was a sufficiently deep cut .	0

gazing ahead between beans and tim ##mie , jeremiah had seen that they were on the edge of a small glad ##e , probably a hundred feet in diameter , almost perfectly round . the ground was covered with small grass - covered hill ##ocks that looked like und ##ulating waves of a minor , velvet green sea .	wearing ? " chapter six samuel peters gazed out across the glistening blue waters of the pacific ocean ; a freighter passing across the horizon , a beam of sunlight forcing itself through an opening in the clouds , battling the rain for supremacy ; giving sam an eerie sense of being inside one immense car wash . sam wore a white bio ##ha ##zard suit specially designed by the good folks at nasa . after that , the suit had been sent to the shropshire patrol company in the small market town of bishop ‘ s castle along the welsh - english border of southern england . the private security company was actually the front for a secret crown research agency set up to monitor temporal disc ##re ##pan ##cies . both the cp ##b and the ss ##pc were member agencies of a vast network of secret research agencies from all throughout the commonwealth . these agencies ; connected via the same head of state , freely shared information amongst themselves . there was much more of a security fire ##wall between agencies of the commonwealth and agencies of non - commonwealth nations . there were some in the higher levels who would love to see the british empire reign supreme once again . engineers at the ss ##pc added a built in time stream reader to the suit , warning of upcoming gravity well fluctuations . in this way , sam would know whether or not he needed to va ##cate the area with due haste . alongside him also suited up , was constable ras ##mussen . the constable collected debris from the time stream as it fell onto the shore of the beach . keeping hold of a cardboard box , she watched sam ha ##pha ##zard ##ly toss various odds and ends into it as he gathered them from the shore line . the beach itself was strewn with rocks , logs and shells ; covered in slim ##y ke ##lp and various other sea creatures . sam had to be careful to not allow his trousers to slide into the pools of sea water winding their ways mer ##rily up the beach . past the water line , the rocky beach gave way to a forested , wood lined trail , leading onto sacred first nation ’ s land . perhaps this was why the gravity well chose this point geographically to settle itself . then again , it was more likely the other way around . the original inhabitants of the lower mainland may have picked up on the fra ##gil ##ity of the quantum foam holding the material world together in	1

##i was doing a search for a particular brand of drilling equipment that he was interested in learning more about . he soon noticed that one of the search results was for an upcoming equipment auction . it was to take place the following weekend at an industrial park near the town of st ##ou ##ff ##ville . matt ##i knew that st ##ou ##ff ##ville was somewhere in southern ontario , but when he looked it up on a map he discovered it was not really very far from good ##wood or u ##x ##bridge . a quick study of the auction information showed that there were two diamond drilling rig ##s , described as complete , but in used , as is , condition . they were going to go on the block on saturday afternoon . a thorough search of the list of equipment up for auction showed matt ##i that the rest of the items were much more related to the construction and ware ##ho ##using industries . there were a lot of graders , compressor ##s , gravel trucks and fork ##lift ##s , but only those two drilling rig ##s that would be of much more interest to the mining industry . it made him wonder if there would be very many other bid ##ders interested in them . the ge ##rm of an idea had come to matt ##i . he spent the rest of the afternoon researching the particular brand and model number of the two rig ##s up for auction . he got some information from further online searches , but he also made phone calls to distributors and suppliers of mining equipment . he was trying to nail down a reasonable value for the equipment that was up for auction , as there was no reserve price on it to give him a starting point .	these things have i written unto you that believe on the name of the son of god ; that ye may know that ye have eternal life , and that ye may believe on the name of the son of god . 13 . christianity versus islam posted on february 18 , 2011 i know that this is a dangerous article for me to write given that it is not politically correct to write anything that can be conceived to be negative about islam . but i am compelled to do so because of the nature of the subject . the current situations in egypt , iraq , afghanistan , iran , and countless other islamic countries have captured much of our attention . we can see the outrage and discontent in the people who protest . history teaches us that we need to be concerned about where these events will lead us . like most of my friends and acquaintances i didn ’ t know much about religions other than christianity when i was growing up . i was raised in the “ bible belt ” in the southern united states .	1

it speaks of a remarkable maturity and i com ##men ##d you for it . " " do you think that we ’ re in trouble ? " she asked distant ##ly , peering into the mist . " i sense no conscious malice about these people , " emi ##an offered .

“ he can deal with the lust ##y ones . ” “ ja , ” said fritz .	did you just happen to stumble across it one day , accidentally ? ” the doctor looked at me and frowned . i could see that he was not sure if i was hostile towards him , or was just having a bit of fun . either way , i don ’ t think he liked the way i framed the question . “ we suspected that this gene existed and deliberately set out to find it . ” “ was it easy to find ? ” “ it was extremely difficult to find . it took us a long time and there was a lot of hard work involved . ” “ could you explain in more detail how you went about finding it ? ” “ sure . okay , we knew that it existed in every animal , because every animal grows old and dies eventually . so we started by looking for genes that only existed in one species , or one group of animals . for instance the genes that only exist in mars ##up ##ials , like kangaroo ##s and ko ##ala bears . and we eliminated these genes from our list of likely genes . “ then we looked for differences in the same genes in two types of animals - short lived animals like guinea pigs and finch ##es , and long lived animals like parrot ##s and tor ##to ##ises . and we eliminated all the genes that were identical in these types of animals . “ after that we started concentrating on the similarities of genes found only in long lived animals like swans , parrot ##s and tor ##to ##ises . eventually we had a list of candidates , and we started testing them to discover exactly which gene was the one we were looking for . ” “ and , eventually you found it . congratulations doctor . but how do you know that it works , that it will work for humans ? after all you can ’ t prove it overnight , or even in a few years that you have found a way of extending the human life span to a couple of centuries . it would take a couple of centuries to prove it . ” “ we have given the gene to animals that normally only live short lives , and so far most of them have already lived three or four time longer than they normally live . and we have removed it from some animals that normally live long lives , and most of them have died of old age in just a few years . so yes , we are sure we have the right gene , and that it does what we believe it does . we have started tests on monkeys and other primate ##s , and as you said , it will take years , many years to	1

i understood , as did anyone not will ##fully self - blinded by ignorance , hope , or ideology , that the american economy was not going through an old - style cyclic ##al down ##turn . i knew that the “ recession ” was going to yield what is now called “ the new normal , ” and that it would haste ##n the destruction of america ’ s middle class . this , indeed , is happening . and it makes someone else ’ s war , ins ##of ##ar as it predict ##s what has in fact happened , an urgent book . america has surrendered to imp ##over ##ishment and is beginning to surrender to chaos . i have watched my country ##men wander around in a state of learned helpless ##ness , furious and despair ##ing but unwilling to change .	it violate ##s personal responsibility . if two people feel that god has joined them into relationship , they must take responsibility for their decisions in it , not look to someone to prop ##hes ##y . prophecy can confirm it , but don ' t look to someone to kind of give a direction that way . there ' s a normal process if a couple - they should find out , or should look out for someone who has similar values , that they feel there ' s a chemistry between them , they are flowing in harmony with god together , similar kind of direction in their life , and there ' s a witness from either parents or those around them who love them , that they see the fruit of god on the relationship , but prop ##hes ##ying that you should marry this one , this is well and truly outside the boundaries , and can only end up in harm . as i shared with you last night , one of my daughters had i guy tell her they were going to get married , and of course that ' s what people use - god told me . great , he didn ' t tell me ! so i just told her if anyone tries that on you , just say well he didn ' t tell me so forget it .

si ##lica : as one study concludes , there is a " growing body " of evidence that links the occupational exposure to si ##lica with the development of lu ##pus ##4 . while the si ##lica exposure in this study was in the farming environment , and other occupation risks include those in sand blasting and ship building , there are residential uses of si ##lica . household ab ##ras ##ives , for one , contain si ##lica . late ##x paint also contains si ##lica . given the proven , though low association , between si ##lica exposure and later lu ##pus development , it would probably be wise to limit any exposure to this material . si ##lica is absorbed through the lungs ; therefore , according to os ##h , wearing a res ##pi ##rator while using si ##lica offers at least some protection . these res ##pi ##rator ##s can be purchased easily on line or in local stores , such as home depot .	and offer sufficient protection . this information is readily available on the packaging of the res ##pi ##rator . sun : a canadian study concluded that individuals who worked in the sun in the twelve - month period prior to diagnosis of lu ##pus had a significantly increased rate of disease ##5 . this was especially true for those who reported having had a " b ##list ##ering " reaction to the exposure . paints , dye ##s , nail polish : in the canadian study , it was concluded that there exists a weak occupational association between artists ( who work with dye ##s and solvent ##s ) and the development of lu ##pus . likewise , there was a suggest ##ive association between workers who applied nail polish or nail applications and the development of lu ##pus . recreational ##ly , those who spent 26 or longer days working with ceramics also demonstrated an increased occurrence of the disease . as for pest ##icides , the ni ##h issued a report in march of 2011 that described a 60 % increase in the incidence of r ##he ##uma ##to ##id arthritis and lu ##pus among women who had repeated exposure to pest ##icides ##6 . smoking in an april 2006 article , the arthritis foundation discusses the association between smoking and the development of lu ##pus . the article states that while cigarette smoking has been linked to the development of ci ##rr ##hosis , graves disease and r ##he ##uma ##to ##id arthritis , the association between lu ##pus and exposure to smoke is less clear . the evidence suggests that if there is an association , it is probably between current , and not past , smoke ##rs and the disease ##7 . this list of environmental antagonist ##s for lu ##pus is hardly exhaust ##ive . one of the difficulties in doing a quality study is that information used in the study is often derived retrospective ##ly - - from the rec ##oll ##ection	0

the amulet did not look precious or in the slightest way important .	i couldn ’ t say he treated me un ##kind ##ly . but there was something missing from our friendship that had always been there before . i felt i no longer had his trust . chapter eight time passed and my fourteenth birthday came and went with little to mark it . it wasn ’ t the true date of my birth anyway , but the day brig and i had chosen to celebrate it , as i could never recall the real one . the two of us used to pass this day in some pleasant way , with the cooking of a favorite treat or the giving of a small gift . other times , we might simply spend the day together , hunting in the forest or visiting one of the little woods villages . but this year , neither of us mentioned the occasion . my lessons with terra ##c resumed . brig finally noticed i was avoiding them and put an abrupt stop to it . this time i set to work with an interest born of determination , promising myself i would soon be able to dec ##ip ##her the writing on my mother ’ s bro ##och . at first , i held on to my resolution not to speak to the priest boy , but it was difficult to ignore someone you had to be close to for an hour out of every afternoon . inevitably , the day came when he asked me a question about my lesson and i un ##thi ##nk ##ingly responded . as easily as that , the feud between us was broken . my eager ##ness to learn made a vast difference in the progress of my lessons . the day arrived when i began writing short words and soon after that , i was spelling my own name . even then , terra ##c suggested i continue with our sessions until my skills had grown as far as possible . i enthusiastically followed his advice , for i was discovering in myself something unexpected . i enjoyed learning . one afternoon i presented brig with a gift : his name inscribed in large , neat letters on a sheet of parchment . “ and what do you expect me to do with this , wear it about my neck like a sign ? ” he asked gruff ##ly , his needle barely pausing as it flew in and out of a tunic he was men ##ding . but i had seen the look of wonder on his face as he contemplated the letters i had set out . here was i , one he had raised from a child , doing a thing that in all his years he had never learned . only pretending to look away , i watched from the corner of my eye as he carefully folded the page and tucked it away for safe keeping	1

my lady , where shall i bear you ? ” eden laughed and gave the peg ##ass ##i directions as to where it might be safe ##st to land and re ##enter the lands of her people .	good points on the linebacker ##s . what about the secondary ? anything to say on the changes there ? i was waiting for you to ask about that . david law ##re has been up there with the best run stopping safe ##ties in the league , with a sure tack ##ling ability and good foot ##work , but kansas brings him in to stop the run maybe a little bit too much , leaving rookie ryan thy ##hen all alone in the ( defensive ) back ##field . when the titans did that last year , paul simmons could handle being the only safety back , but just barely . with a rookie in that same position , it most likely won ' t happen as fortunately as that . dei ##onte knight was a force at the cornerback position , and most definitely left a hole when he was sent away , but carson vickers is ready now for an upgrade in his role . will shan ##ko , on the other hand , may not be prepared to cover the opposing team ' s best receiver , without blazing speed or a great bump - and - run technique , but he is rather smart , which gives him an edge over some wide receivers . division three arkansas stars offensive mvp : antonio fletcher , wr defensive mvp : william butcher , de predictions : 1st in di ##v . 3 . 17 - 3 the connection between connor ain ##ner and antonio fletcher was amazing last year . what are the keys to achieving that once more ? antonio fletcher caught 16 touchdowns and gained 1 , 65 ##2 yards when paired with an above average quarterback , rather than 10 touchdowns and 1 , 00 ##8 yards while with a slightly below average qb . so if you go by those numbers , his production relies on ain ##ner having another elite season . now that ' s a good question : will ain ##ner fall back to earth this year , or continue playing at this superstar level ? he , paired with a suddenly great defence , turned this franchise the opposite direction in a matter of one season , and will now be expected to reach 16 + wins this year . fletcher must be able to stay healthy , as these last two years were the only times when he played over 12 games . fletcher has blazing speed , but can be brought to the very top level by improving his blocking skills this offs ##ea ##son . the offensive line was completely switched around , with guys going from center to left tackle , guard to center , etc . normally this doesn ' t work , but	1

he left the cottage and climbed up the hill which led away from the sea . at first it was difficult , the ground being sandy and un ##firm , but after a while it gave way to a well - worn path through thistle ##s and go ##rse bushes , gradually twisting over the hill out of sight of the sea . the spring was small but forceful , issuing out of a large rock and half obscured by bra ##cken and ferns , twisting and pl ##ai ##ting in diamond strands . he filled the goats ##kin . before going back to the cottage he would cross over a few more hills and check to see if the farmer had left his bread and milk , things which he paid for when and how he could , possibly with crabs or lobster ##s or possibly the odd chicken . he rarely met the farmer , they kept a kind of receipt book / order book in the old shepherd ' s hut , and they mostly communicated through that . on the rare occasions when they did come across each other they would both feel extremely ill at ease , say little , and depart quickly . there were other people too from time to time , once or twice the farmer ' s wife , some children , nearby fishermen or shepherd ##s , and even some hill walkers from the cities , but they were easy enough to avoid and anyway , it wasn ' t really human contact he was hoping to escape from , merely humanity . the key to the hut was kept under a rusty lump of metal about ten yards away , although there was never anything worth stealing except perhaps the milk and bread and the occasional tool . inside it was gloom ##y and damp with the faint ##est of light filtering through a grille at the back just below the ceiling . to one side lay a large tin box , the provisions would be inside . he opened the box and took out the bread and milk , and noticed a little package extra wrapped in a ser ##vie ##tte . surprised he opened it to find a piece of birthday cake , pink ic ##ing and filling , and a little note saying ' our little girl tracy thought you might like to try her birthday cake , she made it herself .

this is not a party caucus you t ##wi ##t .	the dominion over the world will be at stake and it will be provoked by the one you know as satan . after several years of war , and millions of deaths , jesus will return to bring peace to the earth and to destroy his brother satan , or to leave him to be ann ##ih ##ila ##ted in the catastrophe ##s that will follow . ’ ‘ his brother ? you ’ re saying that satan is jesus ’ brother ? ’ ‘ exactly . satan is en ##li ##l , brother of en ##ki . it was he who ex ##ter ##minated a good part of mankind in the episode you know of as the destruction of so ##dom and go ##mo ##rra ##h . after destroying a number of cities with seven nuclear bombs , he was exiled to another dimension , and he will return to earth in december of 2012 , the end of the maya ##n calendar . what you have seen in films about what will happen to the earth in december 2012 will not happen then , but many years later . december of 2012 marks the return of the anti ##christ to this dimension of planet earth . and , hard as it may be to believe , people will ad ##ore him and he will easily rise to power . ’ ‘ but why should the end of the maya ##n calendar mark the return of satan ? ’ ‘ in fact the maya ##n calendar was previously called the ol ##me ##c calendar . it was made by one of en ##ki ’ s sons , who wanted to warn his people of the evil that was to come . the start of the maya ##n calendar is the year of en ##li ##l ’ s exile . the last year of it fore ##see ##s the start of a new era : when en ##li ##l ’ s exile is over and he returns to this dimension . no one knows how he will return , but return he will , and he will walk among humans as an equal . another part of my mission is to alert people about this event , which is almost upon us . ’ ‘ well , this is a most amazing conversation , but we will have to take a break . we ’ ll be back in a minute with more revelations from david griffin , the emi ##ssar ##y of jesus christ . ’ everyone was appalled at david ’ s revelations . they were too many and too hard to take in for just one day . there were people who were horrified at what they had heard ; and many others were laughing , skeptical about it all . the television channels worldwide were full of news of david . now he had a great burden to bear . thousands of people would	1
term is ‘ bra ##hma ##sha ##kti ’ which refers to the spiritual power that creates , sustain ##s and destroys every form in the universe . spirit understood as a subtle moving energy represents an understanding that res ##onate ##s with the idea of ‘ life ’ or ‘ life force , ’ or to use henri berg ##son ’ s term , el ##an vital . a century ago berg ##son published his highly influential creative evolution in which he argued that we can detect the flux of the el ##an vital by intuitive ##ly noting the flowing sequences of events . 11 modern biology is vital ##ly interested in the force that it calls ‘ life ’ even though berg ##son ’ s ideas have been largely dismissed by scientists . in 1944 , physicist erwin sc ##hr ##od ##inger published his famous book , what is life ? in it he described the useful ##ness and beauty of science and pointed to the emerging importance of biology . the question in the title of the book , however , he left una ##ns ##wer ##ed . sc ##hr ##od ##inger , a physicist , could not answer the question and neither , i suggest , can most biologist ##s . the reason that mainstream science is unable to answer this question is because the subtle force called ‘ life ’ goes well beyond the boundaries of biology . what we refer to as ‘ life ’ is the same subtle energy as ‘ meaning , ’ ‘ spirit ’ or ‘ p ##ne ##uma . ’ this is the energy of the nu ##min ##ous one which per ##va ##des every point in the universe . this is not to say that in every corner of the universe we can find ‘ life forms . ’ on the basis of current observations , life forms appear to be limited	the distinction between ‘ life per se ’ and ‘ life forms ’ is the same as the difference between the meaning of meaning and the meaning of a specific phrase . life per se , p ##ne ##uma , and the meaning of meaning refer to the infinite nu ##min ##ous ; the ground from which everything appears and disappears . given the universal breadth of this cosmic context it is no wonder biologist ##s have had great difficulty defining it . traditionally biologist ##s are concerned with ‘ bell jar ’ questions , ones that are limited to finite observations in which a form can be said to have life . for instance , is a virus an example of a life form ? there has been much debate about this . or take the question of how humans are made . biologist ##s know that humans have around 30 , 000 genes but they do not know about the instructions that cells operate under so that they ‘ know ’ which gene to use in order to grow the right body part .	0

“ so good , ” she said , closing her eyes , licking her lips . he smiled . she could hear it when he spoke . “ that mouth of yours is one hell of a turn - on , ” he said , moving her body a little faster . she tilted her hips and pressed harder , targeting her swollen nu ##b . duncan ’ s hips started to pump causing an “ even better ” to spill from her lips . “ you like this , baby ? ” duncan asked , his breath coming faster . his fingers gripping her ass tighter . his cock sliding quickly within the folds of her flesh .	needed ? finish what you started new year ’ s eve , annabelle . come on , baby . come for me , ” he breathed , “ come for me so i can take us where we both want to go . ” he reached between them to press his cock hard against her . when annabelle first started to spa ##sm and shake , he moved his thumb over her nu ##b and manipulated her into a soul - wren ##ching orgasm . and as the hollow need inside her grew desperate to be filled , he lifted her up and then slid her down , sheath ##ing his erection . another orgasm erupted immediately , causing her body to go loose everywhere except where it counted for duncan . her internal muscles milk ##ed him hard , setting off a wild chain of events . duncan pushed annabelle to her back while she still came , whimper ##ing his name , squeezing his cock inside the very core of her body . “ holy shi — ” he began , but the blood drained from his head down to his groin , eras ##ing all thought . his hips worked like a piston , ferocious ##ly fucking the girl of his dreams . every muscle from his toes to his forehead strained , his shoulders and neck were rigid , his jaw clenched . he heard himself grunt louder and louder , out of control with every pump , until his entire body shook un ##con ##tro ##lla ##bly with a long , hard climax . “ holy mother of god , ” he panted , lying on top of her , sweaty and spent . moments later , still breathing heavily , he reached for annabelle ’ s hand and squeezed it . she squeezed back . finally finding the strength to move , he rolled off and sprawled flat on his back , both their heads at the end of the bed . “ annabelle , sweetheart , ” he whispered , his heart rate still off the chart , “ i ’ m afraid you ’ re gonna have to marry me . ” his other hand collapsed on top of his stomach and he closed his eyes as annabelle rose up on an	0

exactly like the vision , i sprinted for her , except i leapt in the air a split second before she did , aiming my dagger ’ s curved tip at her gut . our bodies collided , the blade pierced her skin as i twisted it , and her fangs managed to gas ##h my arm , but the pain was fleeting . fu ##mbling , i grabbed her hair as we crashed to the ground , but she ripped herself out of my grasp , leaving me with a cl ##ump of straw - like hair in my hand . she made a strange howling sound , then got on all fours and leapt away . “ what . the hell . ” i was too surprised to even follow her , especially when she pretty much crawled over a wall to get away , leaving a trail of too - dark blood in her wake . i had to follow her path to find a patch of grass to clean the dagger . pulling the remaining hair from my fingers , i turned back to lo ##rca ##n . he was paler than usual , and his heartbeat had rocket ##ed .	it really is a beast , ” he whispered . “ looks that way . we better get back to your sister . ” “ can ’ t you track it from here ? ” i hesitated . “ yeah , but your sister ’ s alone . she needs to see you ’ re okay . ” he stared at me as i passed but followed in silence until we got back to lucia . she sat alone on a bench , rocking herself with jerk ##y motions . i sat next to her . “ she ’ s gone . any chance of a heads up ? ” her head shot up , and when she saw her brother , she ran to him and gripped his hand , acting as though nothing were wrong . he didn ’ t even notice how concerned she had been , and i wondered how much she really told him , and how much she blocked off to protect him . seeing her visions had been a horribly trip ##py experience , but it had definitely helped . the three of us were shaken for different reasons — lo ##rca ##n for catching his first glimpse of the beast , lucia for seeing her brother ’ s death narrowly avoided , and me for a whole host of reasons . lucia could help me save people , legitimate ##ly help me avoid blood ##shed . but i couldn ’ t even take her with me . then , there was becca , like an animal on all fours , worse than anything i had ever seen in a horror film . “ what will they do when i capture her ? ” i asked lo ##rca ##n , but really , i was talking to	0

that was my little brother - six feet tall , shaggy , blonde hair that took two hours to look like he ' d just rolled out of bed , with bedroom eyes and lashes that any woman would kill for .	i had found myself forced to question his choice of dress that morning .

[ 01 : 21 : 18 . 16 ] mary : yeah . if you take that issue for example , are we denying something that we inherently feel inside of ourselves ? or is the world itself in a state of denial , that it doesn ' t actually allow enough truth to come to us about these sorts of issues ? aj : well in the end all of these things are personally at ##tri ##bu ##table to our own emotional condition	1
‘ because he doesn ’ t like too much daylight of a morning , does our stephen , ’ answered nash . ‘ or that ’ s our best guess anyway . he ’ s not too keen on bright lights in general . of course this may all be a part of his paranoid desire to stay unseen , unnoticed , which is at the core of his professional secrecy , and part of the reason why he ’ s so good at what he does . but , ’ the chief inspector pondered , ‘ i do wonder if he doesn ’ t have some form of ep ##ile ##psy , a light - sensitivity ? a lot of them do , you know , troubles ##ome lads . d ##ys ##le ##xia too . they suffer frustration caused by learning difficulties , embarrassment over not being able to read , things like that .	think we should be about halfway there already , if you ' re sure we ' re going southwest . ” “ well , that ' s good news , ” emery replied . “ if our success is pre ##dicated on my certainty , we can ' t fail . ” another blank look from timothy ; emery sighed inwardly . “ let ' s keep going . ” emery ' s fear and the accompanying images had rec ##eded while they spoke , but as they resumed their trek in silence , he was ass ##ailed again . he drew several deep , shaky breaths , trying to calm himself , but his efforts were to no avail . they were using their flashlight ##s now , and the lights ' narrow beams only made things worse , as figures danced at their edges . emery fixed his gaze on the ground directly before him ; this allowed his eyes fewer liberties and , he hoped , would have the added benefit of keeping him from trip ##ping over another wall . “ you seem anxious , ” timothy said after a while . this time emery managed to keep himself from jumping at the sound of timothy ' s voice . “ what makes you say that ? ” “ you ' re tense . ” emery looked up and saw concern , or perhaps just curiosity , on the younger boy ' s alert face . “ does being out here make you nervous ? ” timothy asked . “ a bit , i guess . ” that ' s an under ##sta ##tem ##ent , emery told himself . “ i had a bit of a bad experience last time i was out here . what oliver said before we left , about getting harvested for our organs , that was very nearly my first visit to new providence . i managed to escape , and one of the king ' s gate ##men found me , but it wasn ' t a pleasant twenty - four	1

and he sent me to summon you and to serve as your companion . all of the king ’ s work involves his son as well . ” he extended his hand to her . “ come , child , we go together . ” warily , but willing , she clutched his hand tightly and he led her forward . on either side of the room she noticed the remnants of a rich and beautiful curtain that had been torn in two , still lying in two heap ##s , and she wondered why it was there . with her eyes down ##cast , she allowed herself to be led across the wide expanse of the royal chamber . it seemed like an eternity , but at last she stood , trembling , with bowed head before the son . here , before the throne , before the king , and before the son , it was too much for her little heart and she sank to her knees . even on her knees , it did not feel low enough . she bent her body , and mind , and heart even lower in rev ##erence to the sovereign one on the throne . now pro ##stra ##te with her face pressed against the floor , she wished that the earth would swallow her up and take her lower still . she sobbed quietly not knowing what else to do . and then , in the midst of her grief and agony , she heard the words that were like a warm blanket placed over her . the son turned to the king and said simply . “ she is mine , father . ” his ? hope fluttered in her heart and she caught her breath . did she really hear him say it ? the	it ' s a very good question and we ' ll discuss that question . because the reality is for the majority of us we feel there should be some form of restriction of an evil act , that ' s what we feel . . . participant : i mean if you ' re saying that any restriction . . . you ' re not saying that restriction is violent then ? it depends how it ' s done . so if restriction is dropping an atomic bomb on somebody , then of course that ' s very violent . if restriction is to get out an automatic weapon , or a knife or something else , then that ' s violent . but restriction can take other forms . so i ' m not saying that if we restrict a person that that is an act of violence . i ' m saying that how we restrict the person can be an act of violence , depending on what we choose to do . so for example , placing a person in a prison because they have been violent to society is not an act of violence .	1

in some cases , when comparing two sets of strata , located at different points on the earth , there would be instances where a layer found in one set , is missing in another . in other cases the order of the layers is inverted and older fossils are found above those that would be considered younger . 36 if the processes that formed the strata occurred gradually over millions of years , there is no reason why a geologic era would be missing from certain areas on earth .	“ it ’ s a message from jeffrey morton ! ” “ read it ! ” lo ##ni said excitedly .	1

' i have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly , being forward ##ed instantly from baker street to co ##om ##be tracey . they were of great service to me , and especially that one incident ##ally truth ##ful piece of biography of staple ##ton ' s . i was able to establish the identity of the woman and the man and knew at last exactly how i stood . the case had been considerably complicated through the incident of the escaped convict and the relations between her and the barry ##more ##s .	a very effective way , though i had already come to the same conclusions from my own observations . ' by the time that you discovered me upon the moor i had a complete knowledge of the whole business , but i had not a case which could go to a jury . even staple ##ton ' s attempt upon lady henrietta that night which ended in the death of the unfortunate convict did not help us much in proving murder against our woman . there seemed to be no alternative but to catch her red - handed , and to do so we had to use lady henrietta , alone and apparently un ##pro ##tec ##ted , as a bait . we did so , and at the cost of a severe shock to our client we succeeded in completing our case and driving staple ##ton to her destruction . that lady henrietta should have been exposed to this is , i must confess , a rep ##ro ##ach to my management of the case , but we had no means of fore ##see ##ing the terrible and para ##ly ##zing spectacle which the beast presented , nor could we predict the fog which enabled her to burst upon us at such short notice . we succeeded in our object at a cost which both the specialist and dr . mortimer assure me will be a temporary one . a long journey may enable our friend to recover not only from her shattered nerves but also from her wounded feelings . her love for the sir was deep and sincere , and to her the sad ##des ##t part of all this black business was that she should have been dec ##ei ##ved by him . ' it only remains to indicate the part which he had played throughout . there can be no doubt that staple ##ton exercised an influence over him which may have been love or may have been fear , or very possibly both , since they are by no means incompatible emotions . it was , at least , absolutely effective . at her command he consent ##ed to pass as her brother , though she found the limits of her power over him when she endeavour ##ed to make his the direct accessory to murder . he was ready to warn lady henrietta so far as he could without imp ##lica ##ting his wife ,	0

in accordance with custom an examination was necessary , but kant ##oa kan had told me to have no fear on this score as she would attend to that part of the matter . she accomplished this by taking my order for examination to the examining officer and representing herself as joan carter .

massive roots flowed out from shore forming living w ##har ##ves while runners plunged into the sea formed support pi ##lings . along the shoreline , knots of trees had been bent and grown together to create the supports and truss ##es of houses . above everything , the enormous trees rose to loft ##y heights . “ drop the sail . i ’ ll take us in , ” ni ##ri said to la ##vin ##ia . they met sk ##ree and his wife gay ##lin as they tied the grey dawn to the largest wharf . only three other boats were in the harbor .	innocent ##ly , la ##vin ##ia thought gay ##lin and sk ##ree were kit ##h . “ nah , we aren ’ t the kit ##h . we are just like you . ” sk ##ree ’ s gaze rested mostly on ty ’ s dark - eyed face . the faint scar on sk ##ree ’ s cheek was visible beneath laugh lines . but he rubbed the white marks over his knuckles as though they still bothered him . “ we found some peace and decided to stay . ” gay ##lin smiled fond ##ly at her husband . her hair was more gray than russ ##et , but that was the only age on her face . “ you ’ ll know the kit ##h when you see them , dear . ” “ we ’ ll go ahead and move ya off the boat and into the inn . get ready for work on her . ” sk ##ree said , leading them to a table at the inn located at the foot of the wharf ##s . the trees that made the structure were so old that they had almost grown together . narrow windows filled the gaps , letting in light . “ you think it will be that simple ? ” ni ##ri asked . “ you being a water elemental and all ? ” sk ##ree asked . ni ##ri blushed but did not deny his comment . “ i don ’ t see any harm in ya . they ’ ll see the truth of the matter and make their decision . we ’ ll send a runner tom ##ar ##rah to let them know yer here . ” after so many days of sailing with the group divided as night and day , la ##vin ##ia had wanted to believe it was going to be that easy . they would stay in this quiet place made of living trees along the sea . then as they gathered their belongings from the boat , ty found la ##vin ##ia pulling the sword out of its hiding place .	0
picked up her backpack , once again slung the strap over her shoulder . she shut the front door behind her . lord comb ##er ##mere led her to a dining room where he had apparently been having dinner alone , as evidenced by a plain white ceramic plate of pasta , and a warm glass of water beside it . lord comb ##er ##mere dropped to his seat , curled the pasta on his silver fork before bringing it to his mouth . “ are you hungry ? ” he asked . “ no . ” “ so tell me . have you done what i told you to do ? ” “ yes . i already have someone in mind . ” “ already ? ” lord comb ##er ##mere questioned . “ you must truly be excited about killing . ” alex looked down , felt the surface of the man ’ s table ##cloth , black and with a silky texture . “ it ’ s the only way i can feel , ” she told . “ i understand what you ’ re going through . at your age , i too was taken in with the same degree of confusion , the una ##ns ##wer ##able questions of what you are now going through . the key is to realize what you are before you let others do it for you . otherwise you risk losing yourself forever . if i hadn ’ t spent so much of my time with insignificant people , i would have learned more about my condition sooner . ” “ is that why you changed ? ” lord comb ##er ##mere paused . “ changed ? ” “ you used to be a lawyer . and a great one at that , or so they say . once upon a time people would claim that there was no case you couldn ’ t win even if you tried . they all admired you for what you could do . and then , you changed . ” “ i didn ’ t change , ” lord comb ##er ##mere retorted . “ i stopped lying to myself . ” “ now everyone is afraid of you . ” lord comb ##er ##mere took another bite of his pasta . “ i could care less . people don ’ t hold my interest . ” “ why ? ” abruptly , a noise carried inside the room . or at least she thought so , since lord comb ##er ##mere had just as quickly cupped his hand behind his left ear . “ what do you hear ? ” lord comb ##er ##mere whispered to the girl , careful not to	he had driven each day so far , and really did deserve the break . however , i was dread ##ing the time that i would be required to drive . i had become quite used to the view and feel of things from the passenger seat .	1
“ you won ’ t have time to get up to the route 68 bridge and then come back down . as a matter of fact , you might make better time on the water overall if you can get a boat early enough . ” “ won ’ t those motor boats catch up with them ? ” asked henry , his second team chief , who had come near them . “ that ’ s going to be our job , ” said joshua .	’ re going to delay them as long as we can . with any luck , they ’ re not going to try to depart for another day , maybe two . ” another thought came to joshua . “ also warn them that another such group could be coming up the tennessee river into kentucky lake ; they might be trying to attack the dam from two sides . ” “ got it , ” said billy putting away his map and looking around for his team members . joshua was nervous . “ and billy , be careful . ” the team leader smiled back . “ you already said that . see you in a few days . ” he took off down the hill at a run to gather his remaining two men and get going . * * * * * * * joshua lay on the top of the hill with his binoculars , looking at the boats . he figured the best time to slow them down was right before they loaded the transports to depart . if the men were already loaded , they might just push ahead despite what joshua and his team were doing . he also didn ’ t want to start messing with them too soon and cause them to speed up their own timeline . he sensed it would be soon though . the men had stopped working on the small boats and there was a flu ##rry of activity in the camp . a sniper lay to each side of joshua . each shouldered the large , and somehow beautiful , barrett m ##8 ##3 . 50 caliber sniper rifle . joshua was in love with the rifles and wanted to fire one , but the am ##mo was too scarce . as a matter of fact , none of them had fired the weapons since they were taken from fort campbell . they had been checked for functionality and cleaned , but not yet zero ##ed to the individual shooters who had trained with other , more pl ##ent ##iful , caliber ##s . joshua decided to use this opportunity to do exactly that . accuracy was not necessarily important to accomplish what he had in mind , anyway . he looked back down the hill to his rear , but could not see henry and the other two men who were providing them security . they had laid out clay ##more mines and prepared an escape	0

seth took careful stock of their surroundings , aware of marc gesturing the wolf after them . paranoid about her safety , seth thought , and wondered how long marc would be able to stand watching from the side ##lines as she built a life in safe haven . it was already clear to seth what angela would become , and he couldn ’ t wait to help her achieve it . “ complete freedom doesn ’ t exist . it ’ s a myth , and i think you already know that . ” seth received silence , and kept coa ##xing , drawing on that spark of kinship he knew she ’ d felt too . “ you ’ re gifted , special . men will kill to take you away from here . adrian will give you as much freedom as he can . ” his blunt words dull ##ed some of her anger , and seth saw fear take its place . “ you ’ re so eager for me to give him what he wants , but when it gets someone good killed , maybe him , will you still want me then ? because these things always come due in blood – he ’ s right about that . ” “ america surviving , that ’ s what matters , and there ’ s not one of us who wouldn ’ t lay down his life to make that dream come true , including adrian , ” seth answered firmly . “ he needs you . he knew you were coming , and he hoped you would be strong enough to stand for the women , and you are ! don ’ t let what might happen or will happen , if you already know , get in the way . the lives we ’ ll save , change , are worth the price . adrian ’ s worth it . ” using a part of himself not employed since before the war , seth pinned her with a sexy grin , o ##oz ##ing charm she had little resistance to . seth was rugged ##ly handsome at the worst of times , but when he flashed those dim ##ples , he was lethal to the camp ’ s women and he knew it . “ his eagles need you too , angie . together , we ’ ll keep him alive . ” angela sighed wear ##ily , leaning down to stroke the wolf . she would agree and follow blindly like the rest , but she had to be careful . for the new life she was creating to succeed , she had to keep marc around while she put	there was a chance for them somewhere in the future , and she intended to take it when the time came . he ’ d more than earned it . 2 “ was it the slave ##rs ? ” kyle shrugged , watching both sides of the mess clear out .	0

our starting ideal will not be infinite ego competition , our priority philosophy is fairness , while knowing no perfect system of value is possible , and surely not a final one made before beginning . what we must have is a way to give work values right ##ly , while humans decide to change objects and services value as they want , following principles , everything stand on good fairness principles , don ’ t twist those or you ’ ll end up in a twisted reality , and the thing you absolutely don ’ t want is breaking the bottle from ex ##agger ##ation or ina ##pt transfer system that grows credits in trees or make credits disappear . so our reasons for getting diamonds will be very different , the reality doesn ’ t even need you to get diamonds , what it need is to give the job sufficient worth , and that worth can be transformed , a ladder of pay , advantages , gifts , you are not limited to credits , always try to get at the most worth ##while direct channel of value of work , people have all kind of preferences , if it is less costly to reality to transform a part of a salary as a nearby free servicing , then the person may like it better too , but i don ’ t need to explain that , ego reality did very well on that face ##t because no choice about it .	am an ambassador of a government , the kingdom of heaven . an ambassador speaks on behalf of a government , so the ambassador cannot speak his / her personal opinion , which would open the ambassador to attack . christianity comes from teachings of ya ##hs ##hua , called jesus of nazareth . this jesus , son of mary , known as the son of god and the mosaic , was fore ##to ##ld by prophets of the old testament in what is called the tan ##akh . the mosaic , otherwise known as “ the an ##oint ##ed one ” is the expected deliver ##er , savior , and king of the jews . when jesus walked the earth , many called him the christ , meaning the an ##oint ##ed one , sent from y ##h ##w ##h , who was to be fully god yet fully man . religion tries to connect the patriarch , abraham , to ya ##hs ##hua in three religions : judaism , christianity , and islam . ya ##hs ##hua never connected himself with abraham . ya ##hs ##hua , rather is connected to king david , who is royalty . the tan ##akh said this of him ; “ for unto us a child is born , unto us a son is given : and the government shall be upon his shoulder : and his name shall be called wonderful , counselor , the mighty god , the ever ##las ##ting father , the	1

duty is seen as a kind of glue that keeps everything going ; without which the collective would fall apart . and as far as current life in the collective goes , this may very well be correct . members of a social collective are burden ##ed with a complex collection of responsibilities that weighs upon them terribly , and most of these en ##cum ##bered individuals are barely managing to look out for their own needs , let alone those of others . living such a life , they might well feel inclined to disregard the needs of others if their sense of obligation was neutral ##ized . to an individual who is living the daily challenge of red ##ef ##ining self , duty is a very big issue , at least until they get a handle on what it is they ' re dealing with .	“ not right now , silas . ” “ why not now ? you dragged me all the way out here because some possessed freaks are trying to get it . we ' ve both nearly been killed multiple times !	1
dinner is over and i ’ m out the door and into my car and headed to the phone booth at a gas station on the main highway through the middle of town . if i place this call and one of my acquaintances happens to drive by they will see me . what if they do see me making a call , they might ask me tomorrow who i was calling . a concern maybe , but i have no choice here , this is the phone i must use , and no way could i call from home . every time i used the home phone my parents wanted to know who i was taking too . they didn ’ t even know i had a date in durham ! i drove to the gas station and about the time i pulled in next to the phone booth i noticed someone was already using the phone . what now , did i pull in and wait , maybe perhaps my appearance would pressure them to end their call . or should i just drive down the road and come back later . i elected to take a drive . i drove out about 5 miles and turned off on a side road and turned around and headed back into town . surely , the person has finished their call , after all it cost money . when the booth came into view , there he is still talking !	car , listening to that music , being that music , it was everything . we drove around , and around and around the town . nowhere to go , nothing to do , but around and around , just so that people saw us . we gave people a lift five minutes down the road because we could . i thought he was sent from above , a known boy , part of the crowd , wanting to drive me around in his car ? me ? maybe he was my escape . of all the girls , pre ##tti ##er and easier and more popular , he chose me . i thought he was solid gold , he probably thought i was a tease . i probably was . i ’ d done nothing more than some hot and heavy hand holding and some dubious , sloppy kissing in the flower park , but my smart mouth and “ fuck off ” attitude gave out an air that i ’ d probably sha ##gged a few lads , but not too many . and because there was never any co ##rro ##bor ##ating story – just hints ( via me via amy via anyone else she told ! ) i was not a sl ##ag and not too frost ##y to have a crack at . we spent six weeks glorious weeks , driving round in that car . he would pick me up from school – i was not too en ##amo ##ured of him	1
she remember this in the morning ? doubtful ##ly . but if so , i ’ m ready to reveal my true heart . novice ##s to live art exhibitions are the equivalent to a kid making a visit to santa ’ s workshop . power tools w ##hir ##l , w ##hine , scream , and chun ##ter . when a chorus of hammer ##s strike chi ##sel ##s , you feel your mo ##lars dance in the back of your mouth . rock dust becomes aero ##sol , riding the breeze ##s or hanging in the air like g ##nat clouds . the dust makes you s ##nee ##ze , so it ’ s best to bring along a pocket ##ful of tissues . a hospital mask wouldn ’ t hurt , but then you ’ ll wonder if you ’ re not bi ##cy ##cl ##ing down some hazy shanghai thorough ##fare . for us sculptors , the fun begins when chunks of marble or granite drop to the ground . people cheer , call out , do the wave . it ’ s my guess these are the natural responses from a culture dominated by spectator sports . live sculpture is a spectator sport at its dull ##est , perhaps , unless you like crashing spelling bees . in the final stages of a symposium , notable for its six - or nine - day format , the soothing sounds of sand ##paper on rock can lu ##ll many a kid or grandpa to sleep . while the sculptors ’ muscles ache as they finish with polish ##ing socks swept across brilliant stone , i like to stop for a moment to listen . and i ’ m reminded of jackie g ##lea ##son doing the old soft shoe . art crosses all barriers . it connects humans to their genetic roots : cave - painters from the upper pale ##oli ##thic era demonstrate our instinct for beauty . to you and me , that ’ s around 40 , 000 years of art . any ##how , “ live art ” brings art to the public , under its eye , and leaves art for the public when ##ce	the well - remembered taste brought back memories of sitting with other guests in the tropical evening before dinner , by the flame tree in the garden of the run ##ny ##med ##e hotel in penang . since it was always cloud ##less , the sky was always bright with stars , and the black sea lap ##ped right up against the garden wall . i was fifteen , and the grown ##ups ( not my parents , they gave me lemon ##ade ) treated me to this delicious adult drink . dusk came early in the tr ##op ##ics , so it was dark by six - thirty , and we watched the waves ripple against the sea wall and little spill ##s of ph ##os ##ph ##orescence spur ##t into the air .	1

of ronald t ##wy ##man , an englishman who had been working in hong kong for many years . according to the papers on the account ’ s file , he had been involved in running many major projects including building the metro system . the man had died suddenly , and no - one had come forward at the time . the company he had worked for had no record of any next of kin , and apparently none of his colleagues knew of any . ronald t ##wy ##man was therefore buried in hong kong , and the bank into which his salary and allowance ##s were paid , froze his assets . these appeared to be considerable , as they were in switzerland , where he had made many wise and very lucrative investments . he had another extensive portfolio of investments in hong kong , as well as cash . the hong kong bank , which pierre had contacted , had transferred their holding of the man ’ s fortune after ten years , and his dormant account had been closed . he had also contacted t ##wy ##mans ’ former employer , but , like the bank , they had not been approached by anyone since he had died claiming to know or be related to the man . he appeared to have been alone in the world . now the fifteen years was up in switzerland , and pierre gustave had been given the job of closing the man ’ s swiss account , one way or the other . he set about in ##venting an heir to t ##wy ##man ’ s fortune . * * * for some years , pierre had taken an interest in genealogy and had managed to trace his own family back almost 300 years , until he came up against a dead - end . he tried every avenue he could think of to discover his missing ancestor , but eventually gave up and admitted defeat . but he had learnt enough to know how to carry out the research , mainly using the specialist ‘ family history ’ web - sites on the internet . now he looked up ronald t ##wy ##man . before long , he had traced his date and place of birth , and both his parents . he now had two	“ i ’ m not even sure what i did hear , ” says brian , starting to pace . i can see he is conflict ##ed too , which helps a little . “ none of it made any sense . ” “ i know , ” i agree . “ but father is the mayor . he knows what ’ s best for us . if he kept a secret , it should be kept a secret . ” the question i have to ask myself is will i have to threaten brian the same way i did flynn and , to an extent , tara ?	1

then , the problem of infinite reg ##ress can rear its ugly head if it wishes , but as long as the model and its fra ##cta ##l structure is respected , then there is no real need to find up to which level , nor down to which level , the hierarchy goes , because experiences and the relationships directing them are essentially similar regardless of the level . thus , there would be no need to master any level other than one ' s own . a prior ##i , there would be no particular reason to think that there should be something as a top level , or as a bottom level , and whether they exist or not would make little difference any ##how , because all that one would need to know could be learned at their level . searching for the divine in the infinitely large , or in the infinitely small , would not be necessary either , as no matter its scale , it would necessarily be reflected in the consciousness of the observer , whether via sensations or men ##tation ##s , no matter at which level the observer chooses to represent themselves . ultimately , the distinctions within this unbroken ##ness that is one ##ness would merely be representation ##al . or , in other words , the super ##org ##ani ##sms comprising the hierarchy , and thus the hierarchy itself , would only be abstraction ##s . nevertheless , within the dual ##istic paradigm ensuing from those aggregation ##s , one ##ness would still be reflected in the inter ##connected ##ness of all aggregate ##s . the characteristics of this continuum , when experienced from the dual ##istic perspective , would be that each and every part of each and every whole , and each and every whole itself , regardless of the level of observation , would be reflected in the others , involved in mutually defining relationships , and subjected to the effects of the actions of the others , both horizontally within each level , and vertically within the hierarchy , because there would	i want you fully rec ##up ##erated from this disaster . after that , we ’ ll speak more about the investigation . meanwhile , i have to get back to the gallery . i ’ m having those cameras installed today , also a new alarm system , everyone ’ s getting assigned their own codes . there will be no more of these shen ##ani ##gan ##s , not if i can help it . ” shen ##ani ##gan ##s ? a robbery , a murder and an assault amounted to shen ##ani ##gan ##s ? mayhem maybe . chaos yes . anarchy definitely . but shen ##ani ##gan ##s ? i didn ' t hang around to debate the point ; i simply got out of the car and headed into the house . i was in desperate need of a shower and a change of clothes .	1

when we entered and i saw his eyes , all doubts dissolved for some reason . he has such luminous , blue eyes , such a peace - giving gaze that even a light shone in my heart … ” “ yes , ” said another woman . “ his eyes are really somehow unusual , so bottom ##less . as if they know everything , as if he feels your pain . ” “ i have also never seen in my life such calm and smart eyes , ” pronounced a young woman standing next to her . the women nodded their heads , agreeing with the opinions . “ and what a pleasant , melodic voice he has , a calm manner of speaking . he speaks so politely with everybody … ” “ after speaking with him , my mood always gets better . after all these endured pains , even i want to live . ” “ i too have such a feeling . ” “ that ’ s what it means to be a good man . ” listening to these words , i halted all my fruit ##less attempts to concentrate and began carefully listening to the conversation . “ that ’ s what i ’ m saying , ” pronounced the old woman . “ something in him was quite unusual , hope - giving . he looked at the girl and said that he will fix her back , but we will have to come here and perform all his recommendations at home . you can ’ t imagine how his vi ##vi ##fying words affected the girl . we came for treatment a lot , for almost a year , even though we live in another region . sometimes there was foul weather and it was hard to come , but anna always insisted on the trip . she became so purpose ##ful that we just re ##jo ##ice ##d and crossed ourselves . every day at home she dil ##igen ##tly performed the entire complex of cu ##rative gymnastics recommended by the chi ##rop ##rac ##tor . and in a year , there wasn ’ t a trace left of her hum ##p ! you can ’ t imagine how happy we were . anna blossom ##ed ; so many fiance ##s appeared right away ; now they are running after her in crowds . . . now we have come for a check - up . oh ! we pray god to give him great health . his golden hands simply created a miracle ! ” “ yes , his hands are really golden , ” confirmed another woman around forty years old . “ he is a professional in the full sense of the word .	as they ate , george asked the children about the sermon . they all talked about what had stood out most for them . “ what stood out for you , millie ? ” george asked her . she smiled .	1
as soon as she caught sight of his car through the trees , she opened the door and hurried outside , anxious not to keep him waiting even for a second . as he slowed to a stop alongside her , she opened the passenger ’ s side door and slid into the warmth of the audi . it took her eyes a second to adjust to the dim interior due to the darkly tinted windows . “ hi , ” she said breathless ##ly . she breathed in his clean , woods ##y scent and ind ##ul ##ged herself in a long look at his angel face .	took a small step back , watching . lucian stood motionless and met jack ' s stare straight on .

christians who have not experienced the joy and content ##ment of precious quiet time alone with god miss out on one of life ’ s greatest blessings .	once you begin to hear the voice of god clearly , you will want to hear from him more and more . you would not think of missing out on the wonderful quiet time you spend with him each day . everything that you year ##n for deep down inside of yourself can and will be experienced to the full ##est if you consistently spend quality time with god . nothing in the world can compare with the magnificent revelation and refreshing that you will receive if you consistently make the quality decision to spend quiet time with god each day . we all know that deeply ing ##rained habits are difficult to break . once again we want to emphasize that good habits are just as hard to break as bad habits . as you develop the habit of setting aside time to be alone with god over a period of weeks and months , you will establish this wonderful habit that will be a great blessing to you throughout the remainder of your life on earth . chapter 9 spend quality time with god in the morning you have learned many facts from the bible about the importance of setting aside quiet time each day to be alone with god . this quiet time can take place at different times during the day . however , you should have one specific time each day that you set aside to be with god . the bible emphasizes that you should spend time with god each morning . jesus christ is your example in every area . jesus knew that he needed to spend precious quiet time with his father each morning before he went out to minister to people . “ … jesus went to the mount of olive ##s . at dawn he appeared again in the temple courts , where all the people gathered around him , and he sat down to teach them . ” ( john 8 : 1 - 2 ni ##v ) this passage of scripture tells you that jesus went to the mount of olive ##s before he returned at dawn to teach people in the temple . we are not told what jesus did early in the morning . we believe that he spent time with his father to prepare for the time he would teach in the temple . jesus was an early rise ##r . he consistently spent quiet time with his father before dawn . “ … in the morning , long before daylight , he got up and went out to a deserted place , and there he prayed . ” ( mark 1 : 35 amp ) jesus arose long before the sun came up to go to a quiet place to pray . when you pray , you talk to god and you listen to him	0

let me explain . if you have ever wondered what is really keeping our economy afl ##oat , it is the rest of the world ’ s belief in the power of the dollar .	of gold . foreign countries produce products and no matter who they sell them to they receive dollars in exchange . those dollars are held in their account at the central bank in the united states . essentially , the rest of the world keeps producing things in exchange for green paper that is backed only by the reputation of the united states as a safe haven for investments . these manufactured dollars are invested in united states treasury debt obligations to the tune of two billion dollars a day . much of our way of life has been financed through the creation of these dollars deposited in the central bank . for foreign countries , the most important function of this financial arrangement is its use in helping to buy oil for their own use . if they don ’ t have dollars , they can ’ t buy oil . since saudi arabia and the united states agreed in 1974 that in exchange for arms from us the saudi ##s would only accept dollars in exchange for their oil , we have maintained dollar he ##ge ##mony . hence ##forth , the dollar became , in essence , the pet ##rod ##oll ##ar . ” “ is everyone still with me ? ” sam looked around to see if anyone was confused . “ good , then i ’ ll keep going . things were going pretty smooth with the pet ##rod ##oll ##ar arrangement until the last few years when a couple of things happened . first , the european union came into existence with every intention of competing with the united states for the benefit of the member countries of europe . to do that , they had to create a uniform currency called the euro . as the european union finds its footing , the euro is becoming more respected and more popular as an alternative safe haven for countries trading on the world market . they have never been bash ##ful about their intent to one day compete with the united states as the reserve currency of choice . ” “ over the years as our deficit ##s and our national debt have increased to such staggering amounts , foreign countries took notice . they are becoming alarmed at this country ’ s unwilling ##ness to curb its excessive spending habits . they have naturally started to wonder if they should be looking at alternatives in selecting a safe place for their money . the euro is gaining favor as the value of the dollar continues to decline in relation to the value of the euro , and the european union is still seeking to have the euro accepted as the new world reserve currency . ” “ in 2000 , saddam hussein began to sell iraq ’	0

she could pass for a ' lady ' from any one of perhaps seven or eight different countries and even fool the real deals . ” he looked at victoria , “ am i not right about that ? ” victoria nodded , smiling at the compliment , and said , “ that is correct . ” “ what col ##lon ##ia did not know at that point was that brenda was already working for us . shortly after brenda arrived in switzerland , european law enforcement sent in a couple of teachers and planted a couple of students . the teachers mentor ##ed her . the students befriended her . by the time she left the boarding school at only nineteen years of age , she was a fully trained intelligence agent . “ at the sorbonne she studied international finance in the daytime .	” he laughed . “ again , all of her teachers and trainers claimed she was a brilliant student . the only teacher who ever expressed any reservations about her was one of her martial arts teachers who was not affiliated with law enforcement . he reported his concern that she could be dangerous ; he thought she harbor ##ed a deep well of anger that would make her capable of killing . that was , of course , simply another jewel in her crown as far as her intelligence handler ##s were concerned . “ she came back to the u . s . and buried herself deep in col ##lon ##ia ' s operations . she only rarely connected with her handler ##s . one of them posed as a regular client of col ##lon ##ia ' s . brenda made periodic deliveries to that person , and usually stayed for a few days of r & r at his home . ” ray asked , “ was that the man in portugal ? ” mac ##neil nodded and continued , “ as i said toni ##o col ##lon ##ia married her . shortly thereafter , au ##rel ##io and his father got into a dispute over both the direction in which the business was headed and the person of toni ##o ' s wife . au ##rel ##io felt that his father was not taking advantage of the full potential of either . so au ##rel ##io killed his father , took over the business and married brenda . “ you should know that brenda rather liked toni ##o . he had rescued her from a so ##rdi ##d childhood and given her an education and a future as something other than a hooker on the docks of galveston . he was apparently fond of her and treated her well . brenda never for ##ga ##ve her father for selling her , but she did not hold the transaction against toni ##o . “ to say that brenda was not fond of au ##rel ##io , who modeled himself more after the central american drug lords than the traditional old	0

here , i think . who is our first witness ? ” he looked over at the mag ##ister ##ial recorder . “ captain far ##je ##on ! ” the recorder cried , pitching his voice to be heard throughout the room . one of the soldiers strode forward ; he looked vaguely familiar to el ##sd ##on . pausing in the clear space between the benches and the table , he said without preliminary , “ on the first day of the month , i and three of my men were on patrol in the parks ##ide district of the city . a young boy ran to us and told us that a girl was screaming in a house nearby . at about the same time , we heard the screams ourselves . we ran forward , but were hind ##ered in our path by well - meaning subjects of our queen , who had heard the screams also and wished to alert us . by the time we reached the front of the house in question , the screams had stopped . a small crowd of young women , wishing to investigate the source of the cries , had gathered at the front of the house , but they were unable to gain entry , as the front door was locked . we saw a man running toward the house from one of the neighbors ’ houses . he identified himself hurriedly as the owner of the house and said that the screams must have come from his daughter . he permitted us entrance to the house and showed us to his daughter ’ s room . there we found a girl , fourteen years of age , lying bleeding on the floor . she had been badly battered ;	she had been punched repeatedly in the chest and pe ##lvis . we have submitted the prison doctor ’ s report if you have need of it . the prison doctor later confirmed that the girl had been killed by her injuries . next to the girl we found the prisoner , who was kneeling beside her , his hand on her throat . he had some of the girl ’ s blood on his shirt and shoes and knuckles . we arrested the prisoner and delivered him to parks ##ide prison for searching . ” the magistrate glanced at the recorder to see whether he had finished writing all this down , then asked , in a voice as thin and ras ##ping as sand ##paper , “ did the prisoner say anything during the time that he was in your custody ? ” “ nothing , sir . we did ask him whether he was the girl ’ s ass ##ail ##ant , but he didn ’ t respond . his eyes were un ##fo ##cus ##sed , and i ’ m not sure whether he heard what we were saying . ” the magistrate nodded and turned his gaze toward the high seeker .	0
when this person estimated ten - days , he did not mean that he would work on this task for ten days . what he meant is that somewhere during a span of ten days he hoped to find the two hours it would take to do this work . over time i will work to transition this team away from ho ##arding to buffer ##ing , but first i need to gain their confidence .	me honest estimates and then trust that there will be a project buffer to protect them from rep ##er ##cus ##sions when some crises comes along and takes priority over our project . tim , for example , has avoided my continued requests for status . i suspect he is not putting the required amount of time into this project . i saw a similar pattern in emails this week . he was given an assignment to define the requirements for a hardware upgrade . he quickly produced an initial estimate that was incomplete . i requested more information and my email was ignored . raj then requested the same information . two days later i still do not see any results . and this was a crisis when the assignment was first given to this developer . my question is whether this developer is truly overwhelmed with other work or is he just using the “ busy - ness ” of this environment as an excuse ? as a project manager i find it inc ##on ##ven ##ient when people tell me work will take ten days when it actually only requires a few hours . but i know that i can either squeeze the pad ##ding out of that estimate or i can use it as a buffer to help keep the project on schedule . when , however , someone tells me that something will get done and then just avoids me i get irritated . i shift from my agree ##able mode to my not so agree ##able mode . in a system this is risky . if my frustration triggers a feedback loop then the situation will get out of control . if , however , i just ignore the situation , then i am contributing to it . the project management term is “ confronting ” . like a psychologist , i must say what i see from my perspective or else the issue will never be discussed . tim will be on my watch list next week . we need to reach a mutual understanding that he will provide status . this is not about power . without his status i cannot assess the health of this project . and without an accurate assessment i cannot appeal to the project sponsors for the additional time we need . and without commitment from the project sponsors this project will not survive . thus i consider my motivation to pressure tim as alt ##ru ##istic . i think i am concerned about this team ( affiliation ) and	0
at that moment , there were rumors among the iraqi ##s that the americans had no more ammunition . a group of armed men built block ##houses right on the streets , using ak - 47 against the m1 ##ab ##ram ##s tanks . during the war , people sometimes died because of such nonsense rumors . the 48 hours in baghdad went by fast , and then my unit quickly moved towards bas ##ra .	’ ve helped him with some large transactions , and believe me when i say he is an extremely knowledge ##able investor . he does his own in - depth research before we do . he usually works out the details of a contract and knows how to negotiate it before our lawyers even get to look at it . karl ##son works alone and keeps his own counsel , telling no one what he ’ s thinking before he decides to do something . i ’ m glad we ’ ve always been on his side in any deal , because he ’ s a very sharp businessman . i don ’ t know much about their personal lives . ” “ thank you , mr . lewis , but the insight you ’ ve given me about these men ’ s professional lives has been very en ##light ##ening . if that ’ s all you have to tell me , i ’ ll be going and let you get back to work . thanks for your time . ” “ not at all , ” lewis said as he rose , shook hands with jason , and ushered him to the door . “ anything i can do for the dallas pd just let me know . ” this case is getting thicker , the more information i add to the stew , thought jason as he drove to the police station . he decided to call the she ##lston ##e group and see what mr . she ##lston ##e could add to the mixture . * chapter 32 chapter 32 { { { 1 # chapter 32 jason paid a visit the next day to the founder and ceo of the she ##lston ##e group , mr . sean she ##lston ##e , who got his start as a broker in commercial real estate , specializing in shopping centers . these grew from strip and drive - up centers to hundred – million - dollar mega ##plex ##es with shops , offices , hotels and condo ##s . after completing three of these large deals and retaining a small interest in each , he went off on his own , forming the she ##lston ##e group seven years ago . sean she ##lston ##e himself was a thirty - eight - year - old graduate of the university of texas at austin . he was married , the father of two children , david and charm ##aine , and lived in highland park , the expensive enclave in the	1

as usually happened after the speech , reid and buck were followed by some big potential contributors , philanthropic people who had the resources to donate millions .	obviously lo ##om large and are the main area of concern but there are other important issues , such as economics , foreign affairs , defence , and social issues . a major reason for taking economic policy seriously is that economic growth provides the extra resources that are needed to spend in these other areas of interest . in a very poor country with little or no growth it is difficult to have much by way of government spending . to develop a comprehensive welfare system , build infrastructure or engage in domestic or foreign wars , requires a lot of resources . without growth , the people of the country would suffer deprivation in order to pay for such things . all governments need to have some idea of an economic policy , however vague or ill - defined this might be . having achieved power ( the first law of politics ) and then kept it ( the second law ) , then those in charge will wish to use this power to some purpose . whether power was gained through a democratic process , taken by military force or inherited , does not affect the fact that power , once achieved , has to be used to do something . even if a leader is a simple dictator with few aims other than power for its own sake , he still has to make decisions about what is good or bad and what is desirable or not . such matters might be given consideration in their own right or else the views might be a simple reaction to events arising within the country or abroad . in the economic sphere there are ten areas of concern that governments in all countries might consider and for which they can develop policies or goals . each government need not have a strong interest , or indeed any interest , in each of the ten areas but whether the government has or not , the issues do not go away . if what is happening is acceptable to those in charge , they can choose to ignore it completely . however , when something goes wrong or events occur that the ruling elite do not like then a policy is needed to deal with the issue . refusing to develop a policy is itself a decision , in this case to let things slide . # # # what are these ten fields which can require economic policies and decisions ? listing them , although not in any priority area , the first seven are domestic - related , numbers eight and nine are foreign - related , and the last one is of general application . 1 \ . inflation 2 \ . unemployment 3 \ . economic growth 4 \ . taking care of the environment 5 \	1

a small noise , “ o ##oo ##off ##ff , ” escaped from his lips as his sunglasses flew from his face . stars burst before his eyes and the world grey ##ed - out just before he landed face - down into the grass . “ dave ! ” sal ##ina was already making her way down the uneven steps . making no attempt to be mind ##ful of the patches , she hurried alongside the trailer to the back end where she stood in a fixed stance , poised between running and staying . phoebe followed slowly after her , executing more caution on each step upon the grass . from where she had been standing at the doorway and the position she was now , sal ##ina could not see any sign of the black patch that had crept up on dave . she strained her eyes to see , but so far she could only assume that he had simply lost his balance and hit his head . “ dave , what ’ s happening ? ” there was no answer . “ oh , god !	, did you see anything ? ” there was real panic in her voice now and she was inch ##ing forward again . “ no , i just saw him fall , ” phoebe told her . “ are you okay ? ” still no answer . “ phoebe , you stay there , ” she commanded and slowly advanced in dave ’ s direction . when dave opened his eyes again , his skull throbbing and tiny mo ##tes pu ##ls ##ating before his vision , he found himself staring into a mass of blackened grass . he must have been out for only a few seconds but it was long enough for the dark thing to develop beneath his face . fortunately , the stench – a rotting smell of carr ##ion – had been the principal factor that drew him back to consciousness . when his mind finally cleared enough to acknowledge the dire situation he was in , all he could do was freeze . “ dave , what ’ s happening ? ” it was sal ##ina ’ s voice calling from somewhere far , far away . below him , somewhere within the strange , foul smelling blackness something stirred . there was a quick glimpse of what looked like a finger or moving root as the soil before his sweat - dripping nose broke open . “ dave , you okay ? ” i ’ m going to die now , he thought somewhat di ##sp ##ass ##ion ##ately . something will reach out at any moment and pull me head first into that blackness . “ dave ! ” never before had he been so numb ##ed , so im ##mo ##bilis ##ed by the concept of his death as he was now , but somehow he was up and on his knees faster than a bolt of lightning .	0

notice what the the ##ssa ##lon ##ians said . here we come to the second thing in 1 the ##ssa ##lon ##ians 2 verse 13 : you did not receive it as the word of man , but as the word of god , which works powerful ##ly in you who believe . so i must first of all value god ' s word . your bible , this bible you carry , you may not understand all of it . there ' s a lot of it i don ' t understand i can tell you now - but there ' s some i really do , and it ' s the bit you really do , you ' ve got to be working on in your life . we can expand what we understand , because knowledge comes to those who apply what god has given them already , so i need to receive it as a friend . take your bible - this is my friend !	, gravel ##ly voice and an accent that may have been american . she was the one to tell me about you . everyone else sounded like they were from somewhere else in europe or talked too quietly for me to understand what they were saying .

" mom asked me . i told them everything that had happened , barr ##ing the part where i noticed the wards on the candles . i didn ' t need to make dad feel worse . by the time i was done talking mom had a big look of surprise on her face , though dad looked really , really guilty . " i ' m so sorry . . . it ' s all my fault , " dad confessed . " i carved the spells into the candles that helped summon the demon . you have to understand , if i didn ' t get those candles made , they told me that they weren ' t going to let your mother go . i would have stood stronger if i had known they were going to force you to summon it . " " well , i still think you did an incredible job neutral ##izing the demon , " my mom said . " i ' m sorry you had to go through that . are you feeling okay ? " i nodded . " good . and , hey , you found your outlet for the fire inside you ! i ' m so proud of you , sweetie .

until last night , i ’ ve never had to interact with anything like that — especially not one who is my boyfriend ’ s best friend . or ex - boyfriend . or whatever . i don ’ t have a clue what ’ s what . maybe my parents are right . maybe i should see a shrink . my head is all sorts of screwed up . eh . no way , that would make them too happy . unable to think about this crap anymore , i stand up and open the medicine cabinet . after fresh ##ening up as best i ’ m able — i borrow some tooth ##pas ##te and use my finger as a brush , having forgotten my bag in the car — i wander into the kitchen for a glass of water . and … i find andrew there . just brilliant . “ oh , hey .	/ di ##v > < / di ##v > < di ##v > < di ##v id = " na ##v ##men ##u " class = " cf visible - md visible - l ##g " > < ul class = " na ##v na ##v - tab ##s sw - na ##v - tab ##s " > < li class ##name = " na ##v - item sw - na ##v - item " > < a hr ##ef = " / " title = " brows ##e books by categories , or view our authors " > home < / a > < / li > < li class ##name = " na ##v - item sw - na ##v - item " > < a class = " na ##v - link sw - na ##v - link " hr ##ef = " / about " title = " learn more about publishing and reading ebook ##s on smashwords " > about < / a > < / li > < li class ##name = " na ##v - item sw - na ##v - item " > < a class = " na ##v - link sw - na ##v - link " hr ##ef = " / about / how _ to _ publish _ on _ smashwords " title = " learn how to publish your ebook on smashwords " > how to publish on smashwords < / a > < / li > < li class ##name = " na ##v - item sw - na ##v - item " > < a class = " na ##v - link sw - na ##v - link " hr ##ef = " / about / support ##fa ##q " title = " read our support fa ##q " > fa ##q < / a > < / li > < li class ##name = " na ##v - item sw - na ##v - item " > < a class = " na ##v - link sw - na ##v - link " hr ##ef	1
##al told him all of it . although he related so ##rch ##a ’ s part in the so ##rdi ##d tale , it wasn ’ t that he emphasized . so when he finished , se ##dge ##wick gave a tight smile . " most men would happily shove most , if not all , of the blame on the witch and her wicked potion , but not you . no , you blame yourself . hell , it sounds like you hate yourself .

now adrian looked startled . " fine .	? " he sounded angry and defensive . " why ?

" " change into a wolf . there are only the two of us out here right now . you can try to get used to it , and practice controlling yourself . " adrian shook his head . " no way . you ' re the last person i want to hurt .

" just a little ways . i ' m going to turn , but i don ' t want to be near you when i do , " he called back . he walked halfway down the length of the lake before he stopped . he then proceeded to take off his clothes right there in the open , which made me blush , but i continued to watch anyway . i was worried that he would be cold , but a moment later he turned into a large gray wolf . i figured his thick fur would keep him warm enough . he sniffed around for a minute before tr ##otti ##ng back in my direction . when he got to me i bent down so that i would be level with him . he sniffed me for a second , and then he nudged me with his nose . i was balancing on the balls of my feet , so when he pushed me i	0
he was not simply a highly trained jewish scholar , though he was that , but he spent years reviewing his entire rabbi ##nical training in light of the teaching of jesus . he did this all before he ever became acquainted with the apostles . with jesus , paul rejected the hell ##eni ##zed judaism in favor of the ancient hebrew mystic ##ism of the old testament . paul is so reluctant to bo ##ast , he barely tells us how he learned the gospel message . he proctor ##ed the st ##oning of stephen just a matter of weeks after christ ’ s ascension . a few weeks later , he ’ s on the way to damascus to extend this persecution , is converted and stays there in town . from there , he hints at spending time alone with the risen christ in arabia , up to three years . from there , he returns to damascus , but has to flee . it was only then he met with the other apostles , and they agree what he learned is what they remembered of their time with jesus . after that , he goes home to tar ##sus for as much as a decade . only later did he begin his missionary journeys .	at pace . all five sy ##lp ##h scouts watched the road ahead , as vi ##gil ##ant now as before they had learned a potential enemy shared that road with them . ke ##lan ##us had split the army again , this time into larger groups , but they now tried to find what cover they could , shu ##nni ##ng the road . bela ##ika and his companions sent frequent ping ##ers to each other , but nobody had yet found anything out of place . though bela ##ika felt uneasy . he had long since learned to listen to his instincts . he had no idea what caused his sense of wrong ##ness . not so ##rce ##ry or the gift : all sy ##lp ##hs now recognized that feeling when it crept over them . but something was definitely not right . as he passed through a rare patch of scrub ##land , with plenty of cover to hide in , he sent another ping ##er , quickly answered by all four of his companions . it sounded as if same ##l had drifted too far south . same ##l passed through arab ##le land and had doubt ##less moved further away to avoid the fall ##ow areas . not only did noisy animals for ##age on fall ##ow ground , ready to sound a warning at anything strange , but villagers had a habit of dumping their night soil in the same place . a few sy ##lp ##hs made the embarrassing and yu ##cky error of stray ##ing across fall ##ow land , but not same ##l . bela ##ika didn ' t worry about the younger scout , he knew same ##l would	1

brought too much attention to us already . if you don ’ t be quiet on your own we will silence you , ” the man said , and for once lego ##n hoped that mole ##th would use some sense and keep her mouth shut . this desire was not for his well - being , but hers . sadly , she didn ’ t have the sense . “ now you wait just one moment — i helped you b … ” she started . “ shut her up ! ” barked the commander . lego ##n watched in horror as the man closest to mole ##th moved behind her and in one fluid movement un ##sh ##ea ##thed his dagger and brought it to her throat . mole ##th became quiet in an instant and a very real fear crossed her face . “ this is what happens if you don ’ t cooperate with us , ” said the commander . as if on cue , the man holding mole ##th pressed the dagger hard and dragged the blade across her throat , slicing the arteries in her neck . a gu ##rg ##led scream of pain and terror rose from mole ##th . blood sprayed out of the wound , covering her front as she began to pass out from the loss of blood . her face washed white as blood left her body , and she gave a slight twitch . the man let go of mole ##th and she swayed for what seemed like an eternity before falling to the dirt . rage filled lego ##n . these men had slaughtered an innocent woman to make a point . this was an injustice for which he would not stand . he moved to his	a large tribune had been raised , and var ##el ##jo was already there , awaiting the sar ##vian ##s and their companions who were making their way through the crowd to the large dining tables in front of the tribune . as they were all seated at the main table in front of the tribune , var ##el ##jo stepped forward , causing the crowd to fall silent . he began his speech , starting with the arrival of the sar ##vian ##s , 95 days ago , admitting his suspicion at the time , which they had by now proven beyond all doubt to be un ##war ##rant ##ed . he talked about the many changes they had brought to sha ##kara ##n , and offering his com ##mise ##rations that they couldn ' t be allowed to return home , he expressed his hope that they would all find happiness here on sha ##kara ##n , ending his speech with the words , " in the name of the sha ##kari people , i officially welcome you as sha ##kari citizens .

it is a comparatively low - cost process and will in time play a significant role in the majority of filmmaking endeavors . this represents a significant opportunity to make high - quality period films with low budgets . black entrepreneurs and filmmakers need to take full advantage of these new state - of - the - art techniques that are emerging out of the digital revolution . black filmmakers need to broad ##en their perspective and explore a broader range of options : set up special effects departments in their organizations , purchase land and buildings and start their own studios and distribution networks . this is not pie - in - the - sky or some un ##real ##istic dream : hollywood was begun during a period of technological revolution and by those who were bold enough to seize that defining moment in history .	i received the spirit of the deep sleep . see isa . 29 : 10 and gen . 2 : 21 . isa . 29 : 4 . thou shall be brought down and shall speak out of the ground and thou speech shall be low out of the dust and thy voice shall be as of one that have a familiar spirit . the meaning of a familiar spirit = the spirit of the dead , ( the holy ghost . ) further ; to know by as ##cer ##tain , by seeing , by observation , to care , recognition and - to discover – be learned – be ski ##lf ##ul – have understanding . this clearly states our mission . the first step to create the soul was for different people to believe in different prophets who brought different h ##yp ##oth ##eses . different prophets were necessary to create different things like the different limbs of the god ##ly body . the whole process is to create our own god . new wine ( spirit ) is for new bodies ( bags ) . new wine is not for old bags . i say ; new wine is not for old fashioned , out of date thinking . the heavens doors are open for those who want to taste it . who is the anti ##christ , the leader ? surely we can ’ t claim ourselves to be that innocent not to understand this writing and the purpose of everything i have explained to you . i say ; do you understand the purpose of you the anti ##christ ? i don ’ t claim to know everything , simply because the scripture say it will take us a thousand years to understand the spiritual world . i also don ’ t claim that i don ’ t make mistakes . in fact , i don ’ t won ’ t to know everything for then i have nothing to learn and the excitement of knowing will be gone . i would rather confess and say ; i know nothing lord please teaches me ! !	1
do you wish to be an old woman with no children to comfort her at the end of her life ? ” i was going to be rather rude and tell her i had no need for human spawn , but my eyes fell on her face and my words died . i could see fear mixed with some darker emotion in her eyes .	thought to have been written by is ##ma ’ il . ruth : author : anonymous . 1 samuel : author : anonymous . 2 samuel : author : anonymous . 1 kings : author : anonymous . 2 kings : author : anonymous . 1 chronicles : perhaps it was written by a jewish rabbi and ##the ##olo ##gia ##n named az ##ra ( ezra ) three hundred and fifty years before isa ‘ ala ##ih ##is - sal ##am ’ . 2 chronicles : this book , too , may have been written by az ##ra . it is written in mu ##n ##ji ##d , ( an en ##cy ##cl ##opa ##ed ##ic arabic dictionary made up of two parts , ) that az ##ra means u ##ze ##yr . yet the author of these books is not u ##ze ##yr ‘ ala ##ih ##is - sal ##am ’ ( a prophet ) , but a jew named az ##ra . ezra : this book was named after its author , ezra ( az ##ra ) . esther : author : anonymous . job : author : anonymous . psalms : it means the chapters of ze ##bu ##r , ( the holy book revealed to da ##wu ##d ( david ) ‘ ala ##ih ##is - sal ##am ’ . although it is said to consist of the chapters revealed to da ##wu ##d ‘ ala ##ih ##is - sal ##am ’ , it also contains psalms of the sons of ko ##rah , asa ##ph , ethan the ezra ##hit ##e , and solomon ( sul ##ey ##man ‘ ala ##ih ##is - sal ##am ’ ) . jonah : author : unknown . ha ##ba ##kk ##uk : a book written by a person whose identity , origin , genealogy or profession is not known at all . so we have given you brief information about the origins of the books of the old testament . as for the new testament ; since we have already given information about its authors and the disc ##re ##pan ##cies in it , we do not think any further details would be necessary . the holy bible contains many other absurd statements . for instance , the rep ##ent ##ance which allah ##u ta ’ ala feels for the flood ( gen : 8 - 21 ) , ya ’ qu ##b ’ s ( jacob ) ‘ ala ##ih ##is - sal ##am ’ dream in which he wrestle ##s with allah ##u ta ’ ala and wins ( gen : 32 - 24 to 27 ) , lu ##t	1

, he knew the man holding sera would kill her . " did you come alone ? not smart lover , not smart , " beth continued to tau ##nt as she stopped before him . he glared at her hate ##fully , but every sense focused on sera . her fear beat at him as she remained un ##mo ##ving within the man ' s grasp . her silent plea for him to leave was the only thought he could register from her . beth ' s eyes sparkled with malice as she took a step forward . " what exactly do you plan to do ? " she asked sweetly . " i plan to kill you , " he gr ##ated . sera couldn ' t suppress a whimper as the hand dug deeper into her throat . the man holding her lifted her , so her toes barely touched the ground . liam ' s eyes flashed violently . the men in the shadows moved slightly forward .

" that really does upset you , " beth whispered . " think about what they ' ll do to her when you ' re gone .

" let her go ! " he bellowed at the man holding sera as his hand wrapped around beth ' s throat . the man holding sera laughed as the other two steadily crept forward .

* chapter 8 chapter 8 { { { 1 chapter 8 un ##rave ##ling a way of life our american cooperative union consists of an economic dynamo of production and a corresponding way of life . we have described how fr ##ene ##tic int ##em ##per ##ance has thrown this economic dynamo out of balance . it now remains for us to see the effects of this flight from temperance in our american way of life . by broad ##ening our outlook beyond the field of economic processes , we avoid the error of believing that prosperity can be restored simply by making some major , and even painful , adjustments to the economy . other issues must also be addressed . a single revolution with many face ##ts fr ##ene ##tic int ##em ##per ##ance helped generate profound transformations that contributed to the present crisis . this in turn threatens the stability of our american way of life . working in parallel in the political , intellectual , and religious fields , the statesman , philosopher , and theologian joined the businessman in bringing about profound changes in society as a whole . just as an under ##cu ##rre ##nt dominated by fr ##ene ##tic int ##em ##per ##ance produced unrest ##rained processes in economy , similar under ##cu ##rre ##nts in academia , the arts , religion , and political life unleashed their own destructive processes . together , all these under ##cu ##rre ##nts brought about huge transformations . they constitute , as we have seen , a single revolution that targets for destruction what little remains of our christian civilization . !

how quickly joy turned to bleak ##est sorrow . or were they all too numb ##ed already to feel either ? but life , and war , went on . now tim ##chuk formally took vo ##ron ##yan ##sky ’ s place as the unit ’ s commander . for jewish civilians with the brigade , survival was much tough ##er during the german offensive ##s . they had no guns to defend themselves and their only safety came from getting as far away as possible from the soldiers , scattering and hiding . during the september 1943 offensive , partisans could only take the civilians to a swamp and tell them to sit down in the water in hope the germans wouldn ’ t go to such places . for two days , they did so , having only bog water to drink and grasses to ni ##bble on as shots echoed around them . as the germans approached , the partisan fighters held them off while the jewish civilians ran in all directions , having no idea in which of them lay safety . es ##fi ##ra dime ##ns ##ht ##ein , her brother , mother , and uncle were all separated . es ##fi ##ra knocked on the door of the first house she saw . the old peasant woman , named ste ##fa , who lived there asked , “ who is it ? ” dime ##ns ##ht ##ein cried out in polish begging to be let in .	to the sky for a second , before the entire third floor of the old house came crashing down upon the dazed devil . “ how do you like them apples ? ” crooked walker shouted , brushing his hands together and looking very satisfied . from out of the rubble , sol ##iah poked his head up and he began to try to stand up . dog breath st ##ooped forward and picked up a brick . he then tossed it like a nolan ryan fast ##ball . the brick connected with sol ##iah ’ s head and it took one of the devil ’ s horns with it . sol ##iah roared with pain and rage . i had hoped that the brick would take his head off . i got up and stood on wo ##bbly knees in the morning sunshine . my grandfather stuck his hands up in the air and chant ##ed to the sky . sol ##iah was suddenly violently attacked by as many as fifty bald eagles . they were larger than life and they came at him with their sharp claws , tearing chunks of skin off of sol ##iah with their talon ##s . their mission complete , the eagles soared off into the blue sky . the look on sol ##iah ’ s ruined face was a terrible thing to see . i knew what he was capable of and that as long as he still drew breath , we were all in serious danger .	1

she needed money for food and rent , she mostly picked it up in case her folks came by to check on her and shame ##d her for other people ’ s waste . penn ##ies add up , charlie would say , though da ##ff had found that two or three nights ’ picking ##s amounted to about a roll of fifty cents and wouldn ’ t even buy a loaf of bread . next to the cash register was a cup of free penn ##ies for anybody who needed one to round off to the dollar . done picking up da ##ff ’ s penn ##ies , the girl sat as before between the pumps , bugs swirling over her , smoking and watching the red light blink at the crossing , the courthouse across the highway , then south as if expecting the truck to come back . smoking one cigarette after another , held between her right thumb and first finger , like a hard practiced smoking man , she finally crumpled the empty pack , wa ##dded it up and tossed it hard as if tossing it at the missing truck . she stood , feeling inside her bulging jeans pockets , long legs stretched , took out the change and began counting it . change in one hand and the finger of her other hand sliding the top coins aside to count the ones underneath . suddenly she looked back at the window . da ##ff turned quickly so the girl wouldn ’ t know she ’ d been watching . next thing , the girl was walking around the south side of the building ,	in a few minutes she came back around the corner , passing the window , then pushed through one of the double doors and stepped inside . in the flores ##cent lighting , up close , da ##ff could see that she was pretty with por ##e - less fair skin and gray eyes . just a little makeup and she could be stunning ; she could be a cover - girl model . she had true shoulders and her elongated waist tape ##red to gently curved hips and legs like stil ##ts . but when she spoke her gruff voice startled da ##ff , who was hugging herself to keep from freezing . she hoped she didn ’ t look scared . “ you got any sk ##oa ##l ? ” “ sk ##oa ##l , yes . ” da ##ff turned and reached up to the shelf next to the stacked cart ##ons of cigarettes on the wall behind her . because of state taxes , the cigarettes were forever going up ; da ##ff couldn ’ t keep up with the price . same as with lottery tickets , mostly the poor ##est of the poor were buying them . she placed the green round can of sk ##oa ##l on the counter . “ $ 2 . 18 , ” she said .	0

his plan - - as all plans in the history of warfare tended to be - had been pre ##dicated on absolute surprise . but if they were forced to wait any longer - sw ##elt ##ering in the gods - awful heat - then he couldn ’ t guarantee that tactical surprise could be achieved . that thought alone scared him more than any thoughts of the upcoming battle . he swat ##ted a fly away from his face while fighting the urge to scream . he took his chain mail gaunt ##let off to wipe the sweat from his brow with the back of his leather liner . a horse near him began to ne ##igh nervously , setting him on edge , but was soon quiet ##ed by the calming words and strokes of its rider .	the gods - be - damned du ##rh ##eim infantry ? as if hearing his thought scout master pe ##llen appeared at the lip of the be ##rm , low - crawling noise ##lessly , his face greeting sir lore ##ll through the pushed back blades of the tall yellow grass . pe ##llen held up his hands and reported the situation through the company ’ s silent language . an up ##turn ##ed palm - infantry approaching - two fingers circling the palm - two companies en ##ci ##rc ##ling the way station - four fingers thrust up - four hundred yards - a fist punching out - engagement in five minutes . sir lore ##ll nodded , mouthed a thank you to pe ##llen , and turned to his men . up and down the line , all sixty soldiers and officers looked to him for his command . feeling the weight of responsibility he closed his eyes and prayed to whatever deity might be listening . taking a slow , deep breath he exhaled , and opened his eyes to focus on the task at hand . a sense of conviction only found on the cu ##sp of combat entered his being , steel ##ing his face into a fierce scowl . he shot up and whistled . un ##sh ##ea ##thing his sword he swung it in a violent arc before grabbing the reigns of his horse , mounting it in one fluid motion . the mount stood up and shook itself free of the dirt and grasses that had clung to it . the men and officers of second and third platoon ##s followed suit . word ##lessly they guided their horses over the be ##rm into the stir ##rup - high grasses , and withdrew their swords , horse bows , and spears . sir lore ##ll was the last one over the be ##rm , as was customary to breton ##ic tradition . what he saw made him pause . the du ##rh ##eim ##ese may very well have been called ‘ companies ’ by military standards , but what was charging towards corporal ga ##rson and his men was anything but	0

this is the place , ” charles said and he entered the building . when they were in , they looked around ; on the wall was a huge map of the fort area . “ bingo ! ” john remarked and walked over to it . he leaned his m1 ##6 on the wall and started to remove the map . meanwhile charles was busy searching the desk ##s and looking over some papers that were scattered over them . he picked up a few and read them and then he walked over to john . john had removed the map from the wall and was folding it . “ i think i may have some answers as to why there are no bodies here , ” charles said holding the papers out to him . “ what happened ? ” john asked . “ according to these memo ##s , when news arrived that the plague was on the northern end of the island , people panicked and grabbed whatever they could and left . this one says that they had a mutiny at the naval command and they took all the ships and left the harbor . ” “ let ’ s get back and tell the others , ” john suggested , and they took the map and the memo ##s and returned to the yacht . charles showed them the memo ##s and john laid the map on the table . * * * “ here we are , ” john said pointing at the map . “ and here is the police station we went to , and over here is the naval command . ” charles pointed at the map . “ we scout ##ed all this area today and it seems clear . ” tim smiled . “ with everyone gone we don ’ t have to worry about cr ##azi ##es , but this place could be crawling with wild animals come to investigate why all the humans are gone . ” jase pointed at the map . “ there is a hospital right here . i should go there and get all the supplies i can . ” “ good idea , ” tim said . “ you can take ji ##ro with you . ” john looked at the map . “ there are several places i would like to scout out . you want to join me , charles ? ” charles nodded as asa walked over . “ what about me ? ” tim smiled and pulled her into	william got up and looked all around . he realized as he gathered his thoughts that he was no longer in mayfair but in a whole different world . his eyes bulge ##d almost out of their sockets as he looked around . he had never seen anything like this in his life . this can ##t be , he whispered to himself , then he began to run towards the towns of the bot ##s .	1
##ic had not been able to cope with the depression , now in its fifth year , and the company was per ##ilo ##usly close to going out of business completely . malcolm agreed , and in 1935 american en ##ca ##ust ##ic was re - organized and funded by a new stock issue and by the con ##tin ##uance of a $ 600 , 000 loan granted by the reconstruction finance corporation . roy then became president of franklin and malcolm remained as a director . ” 56 malcolm was able to turn around the struggling company , founded in 1878 and originally from zane ##sville , ohio . he sold off unused plants , and changed policies and production to resemble that used at franklin . with the advent of the second world war the american en ##ca ##ust ##ic plant in perth am ##boy , nj was leased for the war effort and tile manufacturing ceased . in 1948 american en ##ca ##ust ##ic sold its plant in perth am ##boy , new jersey and combined assets with franklin tile company , with the resulting company taking american en ##ca ##ust ##ic ’ s name . en ##ca ##ust ##ic tile is a specialty tile that creates a beautiful effect and means “ burned in ” . “ the word was first used during the time when different colored clay ##s were set into hollow spaces in the tile face and then fired so the design fused with the body and really became burned in ” 57 franklin tile had survived the war by converting much of its production to war time needs :	“ during world war ii , of course , with civilian building construction completely halted and a market for the company ’ s products estimated at about 20 % of pre - war volume , the machine shop capability at lan ##sdale literally supported the company . a small amount of tile continued to be manufactured , but machinery was designed and built to produce large quantities of ins ##ulating blocks for marine boilers , precision parts for airplanes and a special type of nose - cone for high explosive shells . the change - over to war production was made with relatively few problems in comparison to those faced by many other companies normally producing products for the building industry . many employees left for war duty , but as in the depression , the company ’ s basic stability was never threatened and not an employee was discharged during the war for economic reasons ” 58 malcolm and roy never lost sight of the purpose of the company during the war years and made plans on how they would deal with a return to normal ##cy after the conflict . they correctly fore ##sa ##w the expansion of demand that would result from the ending of the war and the lost years of the depression . in 1944 they began making plans to expand tile manufacturing in lan ##sdale .	0
he was gone before the surprise had even left our faces . his criminal history was still on my computer screen , so we knew who he probably was . a subsequent ins check revealed what might have put wings to the guy ’ s feet . there was a local warrant for his arrest that didn ’ t show up in the computer . but i suspect that there was more to it than that . maybe he was a de ##port ##able criminal alien . or maybe there was another crime he ’ d done we knew nothing about but he thought we did . a few days later another guy walked up to me on pedestrian .	his name in the computer and he popped up on the computer screen as a te ##cs hit for having been deported for criminal activities . don ’ t recall exactly what he ’ d done , but it probably was narcotics trafficking . the man had somehow gotten a new 1 - 55 ##1 resident alien card . strange . how ‘ d he get the card ? strange , but not un ##heard of . this wasn ' t the first one i ' d seen . he might have turned inform ##er and gotten the card as part of the deal . or maybe somebody in ins got sloppy . or maybe it was more sinister . like maybe some corrupt ins officer sold it to him . i told the guy to go into immigration . as soon as he was adjacent to me - - being acute ##ly aware of the runner a few days earlier - - i took him by the arm and physically escorted him into the immigration office . i took him up to the ins counter , behind which a senior immigration officer was sitting , and told the officer what i ’ d seen on the computer and that he had better look at this guy . i also told the ins officer that i ’ d sent the guy ’ s record to the ins office printer that was linked directly to the pedestrian computer . then i went back to the pedestrian gate a few feet away and made out a refer ##ral slip , which i hadn ’ t done yet because of concern over getting the guy into the ins office and not losing him as a runner . after i made out the refer ##ral slip , i pointed out the computer read ##out on the guy to the immigration officer on the adjacent pedestrian gate . the ins officer ’ s eyes bug ##ged when he saw the record and he jumped off his seat in agitation . together we hurried into the immigration office to hand the refer ##ral slip to the officer on duty and see if he needed some assistance with the guy . the man wasn ’ t there . i asked the immigration officer inside where he	0
well , maybe not wiped away , but sub ##sume ##d or superseded , embraced and gone beyond . and if it was alright by his respected elders , who was he to argue ? of all the things he had in his life , and perhaps it was best said that he had a vacuum of material worth , besides the ira ##sc ##ible love of family worth dying for and the un ##folding love of friends that let you be yourself , he was most proud that he had lost most of his baggage shed ##ding all that cr ##ip ##pling shy ##ness . experience was his most cher ##ished possession , the experiences of feeling like you were about to die , but you didn ' t . he had sick ##ening ##ly felt compelled toward terrifying and ex ##hila ##rating self - destructive torment ##s seeing no alternative to the hell of growing up to be a coward all his life , ruined by shy ##ness of all things as slug ##gis ##h and insulting as cancer .	her camp ##er van and a tent into the spot , and wanted to cancel . lucky for us , because it was dead opposite the shower block , and within walking distance of the beach . we were immediately offered this site instead of the original one , and decided to go for it . i knew i was going to have to visit the ladies during the night at some stage , and the less tents i had to walk past in my night ##dre ##ss , the better . ten minutes later , we were armed with an important piece of paper which had to be pinned to the post at the pitch entrance . this laid claim to the area for us . we did this first before heading off to the open ##go store to stock up on tent and bed ##ding . this was ten kilometres back towards the east gate . in the space of four hours we were to cover this stretch of road four times in total . i had no idea of what sort of tent to go for , but steve had the advantage of having camped many times before , and said that we were best getting a four man dome tent . apparently they are easier to erect . i bowed to his better judgement on this . the hire costs were very reasonable , but it is surprising how much you do actually need . in addition to the actual tent we needed a foam roll mat for a mattress , inner sheet and a sleeping bag . the sleeping bag roll was to be converted into a pillow , with folded ( or generally rolled clothes ) passing as the stuffing for the pillow . at this stage i was starting to have second thoughts . it had been a good idea at the time , but i was now wondering if	1
not looking at him , she instead gave the room a careful scrutiny . jack , inwardly wondering at her thoughts and hesitation , decided to take his own seat while he waited for to start her story . as he waited for her to begin , jack looked her over with appreciation – she was in her mid - twenties , with no wedding band on her hand , a pale face , and was wearing an expensive brown dress with burgundy trim . long blond hair hung down beyond her shoulders where a small matching brown bonnet hung around her neck . she was obviously rich and well - groom ##ed – the product of wealth and proper schooling . he decided that she was quite beautiful , but with that slightly po ##ut ##y mouth that indicates a woman who was used to getting her way . her eyes appeared tired , with circles underneath and red ##ness at the corners . she fi ##dget ##ed and continued to look over the dusty office . she then took off her gloves and nervously twisted them in her hands .	. she was also obviously not used to visiting the poorer side of town . he decided it would take some doing to get the story out of her . “ please , what can i do for you ? ” he said smoothly . “ you must not worry since everything discussed in this office is quite confidential . ” she licked her lips , revealing a dai ##nty tongue , and began to talk in a high timor ##ous voice . “ dear sir , my name is faith hanson . i was sent by my father , the honorable daniel hanson , to ask for your help . you once did a small service for my dear uncle , james dawson , when he was in a most delicate situation . we are hoping you can do the same for us . ” “ yes , i remember that case . it was a violent rather than a delicate situation . i ended up with a knife wound from that blackmail ##er . but please , do continue . ” she gave him a small shy smile before continuing with her story . “ my brother has been most mysterious lately . and now he is gone . we need someone to help us . ” she then shook her head with confusion and sighed . “ what exactly are you asking from me , miss ? ” he asked . “ please , i made a bad start of it . let me start again from the beginning . ” “ go ahead . ” she cleared her throat . “ last year , my brother lawrence started working for the war department as a clerk . my father got him the job and it seemed to suit lawrence rather well . he spoke highly of his superior and seemed at ease at	0

" since neither the globe nor human leaning ##s toward war will change overnight , it is important for the west to maintain military and economic power - but also to recognize that power includes the ability to allow other countries their differences and self - empowerment . chapter 20 democracy versus terrorism this final chapter is written with the urge to pull together all of the loose ends of previous pages , solve all the problems and anti ##ci ##pate what lies around the next bend . these are difficult assignments because there is no conclusion to a story based on a living world . as i hope the previous chapters adequately demonstrated , the terrorist threat is as change ##able as global events , with danger levels rising and falling as fast as the bar ##ometer of political turmoil depicted in the daily newspaper headlines . while the threat of terrorism will grow , and will likely become an even more common war tactic , there is much a democratic society can do physically to protect it from terrorists and politically to prevent the es ##cala ##tion of gr ##ie ##vances from reaching catastrophic levels . this book began with a look at events that took place within a sixty - day period of the world trade center bombing . while we watched authorities si ##ft through the rubble and track the suspects , we also watched the drama of the fifty - one - day siege of the david ##ian cult group in wa ##co and , at the same time , we waited to see if another race riot would explode in los angeles as the jury brought in the verdict ##s against the police officers who had been accused of beating rodney king . as those events were only starting to become clear , we discovered that another group of islamic ex ##tre ##mist ##s had been stopped short of setting off more bombs at the united nations and other new york city targets , and we also learned that a group of skin ##heads had been stopped short of a mis ##guide ##d attempt to start a race war by bombing a black church in los angeles . almost as a backdrop to all of these happening ##s , heated political debates raged regarding inner - city economic	1

play nice and act broken . time to act as if i thought it wasn ’ t too late to stop the ambush that i knew for a fact was coming . “ i ’ m sorry i ate chocolate cake , or rather , was going to , ” i said with theatrical sincerity . “ i ’ m sorry , isn ’ t going to make you strong , private . what are you going to do to make sure that you are strong , lu ##do ? that is , assuming your platoon isn ’ t already planning on helping you remember , ” he said , again calling the platoon to vi ##gil ##ante justice . “ i ’ m not going to eat cake anymore , drill sergeant ! ” i yelled with enthusiasm and pretended to be as dumb as he wanted me to be . i knew this issue was bigger than the cake . this was about the call to arms , but he didn ’ t have to know i understood that , not yet anyway . what he wanted was the first sac ##ri ##fi ##cial lamb , and somehow , just luck i suppose , i ’ d become the sacrifice . what i wanted to say was , “ so legally , you aren ’ t allowed to di ##cta ##te what i do or do not eat , otherwise you would produce some military code stating i wasn ’ t allowed to eat cake … instead , you rely on the ignorance of the mob . you rely on the fact that i fear the group , when in all actual ##ity , the group is divided between its allegiance to me as a member of their crowd , with you as our common enemy , and their desire to be as comfortable as possible and reassured that they are successful soldiers by following your directive to beat me physically . i don ’ t doubt that they will attack me tonight , but i do doubt whether any one of these soldiers will feel that they accomplished anything by doing so . ” this was obviously not the time to say these things , but had it been , the entire methodology used on me in the future would have to be revised . i wasn ’ t going to be a monkey . i was going to be a leader , and this i knew to be a fact . the weight problem was , for now , hind ##ering that ; but when they came for me tonight , there would be no begging and pleading . i ’ d simply insult my attackers , prove i was strong enough to be an individual alone , and know that slowly	idols of wood and stone , silver and gold , or gods of river and stream , hearth and furnace are merely lifeless , man - made or man - imagined things .	1

that your foul armies passed by my people ' s forest , and then at last i decided i had to put an end to your conquest , or let the rest of drag ##ora ##s become enslaved . " time and time again i was compelled to turn back , until i encountered these worthy companions . then , when brave gil saved my mother from your curse , i realized something . i had intended to make you beg for mercy and bargain for my mother ' s release from her wr ##aith form , but then when she was freed and i thought i no longer needed anything from you , i began to realize that there was something far important i must have from you , though i did not yet know what it was .

i shall endeavor to do so here ##in , but first shall set forth certain facts and circumstances concerning my own position and the course and conduct of the case as a whole . as you know , i did not pre ##ci ##pit ##ate this investigation nor sol ##ici ##t the job of conducting it . i had no information the undertaking was even contemplated until approaches were made by your office .	at the start , i was given to understand there was no reason to expect any funds additional to the original $ 25 , 000 app ##ropriation of the board of supervisors . our campaign was therefore planned and carried out on a comparatively small scale , considering the problem at hand , in order to remain within the limitations of the fund . when the second app ##ropriation was made available on july 9 , 1936 , our staff and program was expanded and the investigation from then on was conducted along broader lines . when results began to be manifested by the new lines of inquiry , a series of developments occurred which so reduced the general effectiveness of the undertaking as to make it ad ##vis ##able to terminate it . it is unfortunate , since a second and larger app ##ropriation was eventually forthcoming , that the entire fund was not made available at the start so the enterprise could have commenced along more comprehensive lines with the maximum opportunity for greater and quicker results . a comparison between the accomplishments of this investigation and similar enterprises here and elsewhere does not leave us in an un ##fa ##vor ##able position . so far as my associates and myself are concerned , however , we are greatly disappointed because we feel the full potential ##ities of the undertaking were not realized . we hoped and endeavor ##ed to achieve a thorough house ##cle ##ani ##ng in the police department and we believe that we could have gone a great deal farther toward accomplish ##ing this objective if we had been given a fair measure of support by the city administration . a graf ##t investigation readily lend ##s itself to controversies and sensation ##al news stories . the history of a number of these cases reveals that they have generated a tremendous amount of ill feeling and business and have been accompanied by lu ##rid accusations , personal vi ##li ##fication and general mud - sling ##ing . this has occurred to such an extreme degree in some instances that the original purpose of the inquiries was lost sight of while the participants engaged in a melee of insults and op ##pro ##bri ##um . we resolved in the beginning that , so far as it was within our power , this case would be kept on a different plane . in my endeavor to adhere to this resolution , i frequently refrain ##ed from publicly pointing out conditions and circumstances which hampered and stu ##lt ##ified our efforts on he	0

think of it in terms of the greatest command ##ment . you might say that the personal pie ##ty crowd is falling off on the “ love god ” side while the social justice crowd is falling off on the “ love your neighbor ” side . here ’ s the problem with setting the equation up this way . loving god and loving your neighbor move you in the same direction . these are not competing ends . if we ’ re loving god in a way that neglect ##s our neighbor , we ’ re not really loving god . if we ’ re loving our neighbor in a way that neglect ##s god , we ’ re not really loving our neighbor . in other words , it would be fool ##hard ##y to look for sol ##ace in our displacement by saying , “ at least i ’ m living a holy life , ” or , “ at least i ’ m loving my neighbor . ” there is no personal holiness apart from loving our neighbor and there is no genuine love for neighbor apart from personal holiness .	the bulk of the last century , most evangelical churches have been falling off on the personal pie ##ty side of the saddle — emphasizing personal holiness and evan ##gel ##ism , but neglect ##ing the physical needs of the poor and op ##pressed . thankfully , a re - center ##ing is well under way so that social justice causes are no longer the exclusive domain of theological ##ly liberal churches . gary ha ##uge ##n , president and ceo of international justice mission ( i ##jm ) , has been at the forefront of this charge , and the preface to the tenth anniversary edition of his book , good news about injustice , speaks to this evangelical shift : the reason for writing good news about injustice was very simple : in 1999 there were very few articles about justice [ and ] no book - length treatment of the problem of injustice in the world , god ’ s view of it , and the role of god ’ s people in addressing it . this seemed an absurd state of affairs considering the magnitude of the problem [ and ] the massive portions of the bible that address this problem . … in 2009 , however , we must acknowledge that a sea of change has taken place . a transformation of stunning speed and breadth is altering the christian community — a transformation that offers great hope for the body of christ and the world . discussions of biblical justice are bursting into the mainstream christian dialogue , church leadership , and ministry . 1 that ’ s the good news about injustice . here ’ s the bad news : as christians around the world have taken on the needs of the poor and op ##pressed , abortion - vulnerable children have largely been left by the	0

started with potatoes , peas , spin ##ach , let ##tu ##ce , r ##hu ##bar ##b , tomatoes , pumpkin ##s and rock ##mel ##ons . he hired a rotary ho ##e to dig up the soil . after preparing the soil he laid out his garden beds . the rock ##mel ##ons and pumpkin ##s were placed in small mounds , so the vines could spread easily . sweet corn was also a big success . initially , the gardens were smaller . as dad ’ s experiment succeeded , the size of the gardens grew . so did the work load ! since , i was the oldest child . i found myself to ##iling in the gardens after school . dad used an old woven wire mattress as a sc ##ree ##d to filter out pebbles and hard cl ##ump ##s of soil . the sc ##ree ##ded soil made excellent tops ##oi ##l . he also made his own liquid man ##ure . nan ##na ’ s cho ##ok pen was a great place to obtain man ##ure . dad just added water to the man ##ure . the liquid man ##ure was especially good for leaf ##y vegetables , such as let ##tu ##ce and spin ##ach . mum owned two house blocks next to nan ##na ’ s place . nan ##na had given each of her children blocks of land . when nan ##na bought the land it was way out in the scrub and it was very cheap . dad had the bright idea that the block next to nan ##na ’ s house was an ideal place to grow potatoes . a rotary ho ##e was hired to till the soil . the sub ##so ##il was clay ; dad bought bags of lime to break up the clay soil . when dad was satisfied the soil was ready , he bought seed potatoes and planted them . the potato patch took up half the block . poor old ‘ mug ##gins ’ had more work to do after school , and on weekends . dad had a really good crop of potatoes , he realised there were far too many for us to eat . he decided to sell the surplus . out came the scales . out came the old newspapers . he weighed out about three lb . of potatoes ( approximately 1 . 4 kg ) , and we wrapped them up in the newspapers . that seemed a good sized parcel , so the potatoes were wrapped up in 3 lb . parcels . “ okay , jon get your billy cart and load up the potatoes . ” suddenly , i became aware the dad wasn ’	“ two ##pen ##ce a pound is very good value . charge people six ##pen ##ce for each parcel , ” “ where do you expect me to go with these potatoes ? ” “ anywhere you like in the area . ” said dad .	0

"	it is primarily from the old testament that we learn what we know about this invisible being we call god . in the old testament we learn that god is una ##pp ##ro ##ach ##able by anything or anyone uncle ##an , or anyone tainted by sin . in order for the people of israel to come into the presence of god , they had to undergo careful and detailed rituals of sacrifice and cleansing from sin . in the old testament , we learn about god ’ s holiness , his absolute perfection and complete “ other ##ness ” from all created things . god is revealed as so bright that he must “ cloth ##e ” himself with dark clouds in order for the israeli ##tes not to be destroyed by his mere presence on mount sinai . free and faithful in the old testament we learn that god comes and goes in the affairs of humans as he please ##s , not as humans decide . we learn that god is the architect and maker of all that is , and that everything has its being and continued existence only in him . we learn that god is not manipulated by rituals , magic , sacrifices or inca ##ntation ##s like the gods of the nations around israel . we learn that god is completely and eternal ##ly faithful , that he loves his people with a ste ##ad ##fast love , and that he makes promises and keeps his word . we learn that nothing can keep god from doing what he decides to do . and we learn that god ’ s purpose is to save and red ##eem broken men and women , to heal the weak , to lift up the weary . we learn that god cares about and is intimately involved in every detail of his created universe . we learn that even though sin is catastrophic ##ally destructive to human beings , god does not forget his work , and he acts to save and repair and set humans right so they can be restored to him . we learn that humans are helpless without god , that everything humans do is possible only because god allows them to have their own way .	1

already as young children , they ' re taught to shield their minds from patterns that drag human beings towards na ##rc ##iss ##istic , violent and exploit ##ative tendencies . not generally motivated by jealousy , rage , anxiety or hate , people stopped continually destroying their own creative powers , or those of others . in comparison to our world , they have at their disposal hugely more creative energy in each individual and society than we do . heights of accomplishment are achieved in every area of human endeavor that in our world today would seem almost supernatural . in the land of israel live some millions of jews , alongside others such as arab muslims and christians . the jews live cl ##ea ##ving to god and torah and rooted in the land .	holy story , they live with the biblical themes etched into the valleys and hill sides , and into the ruins of ancient holy sites ; david an ##oint ##ing solomon at the rocky face of a spring on the slope of this hill , abraham and isaac walking towards the alter on mount god - will - be - seen . the land is enchanted , pu ##ls ##ating with the power of those events ; history and myth embracing each other in the steps of an ancient walking meditation . in this valley , sage ##s birth ##ed mis ##hn ##ah and mid ##ras ##h ; in these caves others pressed oil and wage ##d war ; on these hills walked amos or ho ##sh ##ea , isaiah or jeremiah . wandering around the land you ' d meet jews at these locations . the legal and political life of the jews is organic ##ally a part of torah life like the way they live in the land . a liberal social - democracy , variant streams of culture and ideology struggle for fuller expression in the collective life of the jews , which forms a politically and culturally autonomous state confederate ##d with palestine and others in the regional branch of the world federal government . ( you don ' t think that a modern torah state would be a liberal social - democracy ? read up on r . cha ##im hirsch ##ens ##oh ##n , 1857 - 1935 ) . as jews struggle with jews over the meaning of the torah state , streams of thought and value emerge , each reflecting a unique prism of tradition . social and political discourse is rich in biblical poetry and narrative , hal ##achi ##c argument ##ation , mid ##ras ##h and z ##oh ##ar . the israeli cultural scene is a sea of meaning and energy flowing forward and back as waves above and currents below lift ancient long hidden treasures from the deep and swirl them through contemporary winds , in and out of bays and twisting rivers , dropping them on new sea beds , decorated with the colors and textures of changing times .	0
eyes scroll ##ed between the two of them . “ all right , you two talk , fight , make up or do whatever it takes but fix your personal mess now . i ’ m going to the crew bar and when i come back you will either be in your respective cabins or in diego ’ s cabin together . just make sure you reach some sort of conclusion . the passengers already drained out my patience today . ” she ordered with a twin ##ge of authority and left them alone . at that point denise was fighting the tears and trying to be strong . “ i guess that means you are still mad at me . ” he assumed . “ how could i not be after listening to you nearly confess ##ing you still have feelings for your ex ? ” “ that ’ s not what i was saying . ” “ really ? you must think i ’ m beyond stupid . ” “ i told you i was upset because she ’ s marrying the guy , not that i still have feelings for her . ” denise felt her body stiff ##en on the chair . “ and ? ” he snorted . “ i am upset because i always had this fantasy that something would go wrong with and then she would come back and admit she had made a bad choice . and i would very happily tell her i didn ’ t want her back and that i deserve better . that would make it fair . i don ’ t have feelings for her anymore . i just wanted a chance to make her feel what i felt : rejection . i know it ’ s stupid and childish and i ’ m sorry that i told you . ” she stared at him puzzled . “ i don ’ t understand . ” her voice was broken . you will soon , and i ’ m	he thought without saying the words . “ denise , this was about my pride . now could you please stop being upset at me and come back to our room . i don ’ t like to see you like that . let ’ s forget about it , all right ? ” she kept staring at him without a word and when nothing was thrown his way he started worrying . maybe he had pushed too hard this time . for his relief she wrote a note for sofia thanking her and returned with him to his cabin in silence . after he got into bed and turned out the lights denise tuned around from looking at the wall and hugged him in the dark . he sighed , feeling a heavy weight getting out of his chest and kissed her tenderly . she kissed him back without saying a word and closed her eyes but she didn ’ t sleep for a long time .	0
i now have an understanding of my mission in life . everyone has a mission . most people will never know what there calling is because they fail to look within . people don ’ t know about their calling because they are distracted by false illusions , pulled away from the truth . they ’ re walking the false path , like i have for so long . for many years i search the earth looking for gold . thinking it was the source of happiness . i believed if i found money i could buy everything i very wanted and it would bring true happiness . i couldn ’ t have been more wrong . it doesn ’ t matter where you look or how long , if your goal is the wrong path you will never find truth in it . i was shown the way . shown the right fold path . i gave myself over to the higher power and they showed me the true meaning of my existence . i saw how the world could be right . i saw the world as one .	through his in ##ept ##ness because the yellow fl ##akes winked at him like so many all ##uring eyes . “ this is private property ! ” called a woman ’ s voice from behind him . holt ##z ##cl ##aw whirled and saw a tall , slender woman in a riding suit . her golden hair was drawn back and capped with narrow - br ##im ##med straw hat , encircled by a blue - and - white ribbon . she wore boots , gloves , long sleeves , and a high collar . her face was shaded by her hat , and a small glimpse into the shadow revealed dark deep - set eyes . there was another flash of green light , a rush of bubbles , but this time not from a strange draught . it was the sudden sight of love ##liness , and he was tres ##pass ##ing against it . holt ##z ##cl ##aw felt a pang of laps ##ed decor ##um . he should have do ##ffed his hat for the lady or at least tipped it , but he was not wearing his hat ; it was filled with mud . “ i stopped for a drink , you see , and something was gleaming in the river , ” he said , which was a foolish introduction and not at all suggest ##ive of strength and command . the woman ’ s face softened , and through the narrow red fis ##sure of her lips , holt ##z ##cl ##aw saw perfect teeth . “ i shouldn ’ t have been so concerned , ” she said . “ it doesn ’ t look like you know what you ’ re doing . ” “ i confess that , by trade , i ’ m not a miner . ” “ what is it that you do then	1

i couldn ’ t believe it ; i was getting a second chance . i started to wonder about some of the first things i wanted to do when i was released ; there were so many things i wanted to do . it had been a long time since i had been involved in a relationship . i wondered if i … well , anyway i ’ ll have to cross life ’ s bridges as i come to them .	back on my bunk and continued my wish ##ful thinking . i was fifteen when i got expelled from school for smoking pot . not long after that , my daddy started physically abu ##sing me . after so many beating ##s , i decided to leave home ; i moved around a lot and picked up small jobs just to get by . i was arrested several times before i got a full - time job . unfortunately , that didn ’ t last long ; i got fired . i knew i eventually would because i was always late ; i had to walk to work and it was a good piece away . after that , i was in and out of drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs for years . i have to say , my life has been something . then , out of the blue , my mind wandered to the night in the alley . all i know is that everything happened so fast . i came upon the dead body lying in the alley . i knelt down beside it to see if there was anything i could do to help . i saw the crow ##bar lying next to the body . without thinking , i picked it up . and that ’ s when all the drama started . the police rushed into the alley with their headlights on bright and their blue lights flashing ; the lights were so bright i couldn ’ t see . the police jumped out of their cars with their guns pointed at me , yelling for me to drop the crow ##bar , get down on the ground and put my hands behind my head . i froze in my tracks ; i didn ’ t know what to do because i hadn ’ t done anything wrong . all i could think to do was yell out that i didn ’ t do it ; i was only trying to help him . but , that didn ’ t matter to the police . they repeatedly told me to drop the crow ##bar and get on the ground . slowly , they began to move in . i dropped the crow ##bar when one of the officers pushed me down on the ground and cuff ##ed my hands behind my back . i never said another word ; it wouldn ’ t have made a difference anyway . the situation i had been found in had already told my story	0
instructions for you . until then . ” he bowed gracefully and made his leave , his stride confident as he made his way through the tables to the entrance . the guards followed him out the door , taking the tension in the room with them . claire collapsed onto the seat next to her . she wondered if she might have answered too fast . would they be able to keep up their act in such a situation ? well , the elves probably could . she looked up to aero ##n for re ##ass ##urance . “ i ’ m sorry , i just got excited , ” she said . “ i ’ ve never been to a ball before . ” aero ##n sat down next to her . “ it will be fine . ” he put an arm around her shoulders . “ besides , it will help take your mind off of things . right ? ” he looked up at far ##ron and waited for him to say something . they exchanged looks , their faces serious . “ what ? ” claire looked between the two , but they ignored her . “ what is it ? i ’ m getting really tired of all the secret keeping . ” aero ##n ’ s arm dropped from her shoulders . “ you do not really think he would invite us just for the fun of it , do you ? ” “ what do you mean ? ” far ##ron sat down finally . “ a man like him , i don ’ t trust him . ” “ and why do you say that ? ” claire asked . “ with a smile like that , you just know he ’ s hiding something . ” “ like you ? ” the words slipped out of her mouth before she could stop them . far ##ron fixed her with a cold gaze . “ at least he is polite about it , ” she said with a slight smile . the elf shrugged . “ we can ’ t turn him down , or it would seem that we are slight ##ing the king . he wants something . ” aero ##n just nodded . her stomach sank . the grand visions faded before her eyes . it did seem a little curious that a general would just invite them to a ball like that , even if it was to make up	“ so what should we do ? ” she looked across the table at far ##ron . “ keep up our little char ##ade . ” he shrugged his shoulders . “ he is right , for once , ” aero ##n said , and far ##ron shot a glance at him . “ you do not need to worry . i will teach you everything there is to know about being a lady . ” he wr ##ig ##gled his eyebrows at her .	0
had burned down years ago , and since the judge died the place was hardly used at all , but such as it was it belonged to pat . immediately she went back to waitress ##ing , the job she found most cong ##enia ##l , but her years of steady work , and therefore his grandmother ’ s challenge , bore other strange and wonderful fruit . the first fruit came when , taking his cue from his grandmother ’ s will , he channel ##ed the hurt and feelings of inferior ##ity from mrs . gr ##und ##y ’ s looks of disapproval into studying . against all odds , he rose above the chaos of his home life and became a good student in high school , particularly in mathematics and sciences . he developed an interest in computers , becoming so good that he actually wrote programs for the computer system at courtney academy . he got a weekend job at the local radio shack and became a w ##hi ##z at electronic ga ##dget ##ry , even building himself a work ##able computer before they became widespread appliances in the home . his example inspired his younger brother to study and apply himself so that all the mrs . gr ##und ##ys of was ##ka who had shaken their heads at the boys ’ prospects were mort ##ified to be proven wrong . it was a small consolation , though lowell deep inside still felt as if he deserved their looks of disapproval . this was a feeling that took him a long time to shake . even now it could occasionally still come back to him in the dark soul of the night when he would wake from a dream and find himself a despised and father ##less boy . but as mrs . gr ##und ##y ’ s disdain faded and as his teacher ’ s praise and his boss ’ s trust in him at the radio shack grew more common , he did finally manage to distance himself from his inherited sense of inferior ##ity .	to the outside world , in fact , he became a self - confident young man , competent at everything he did and confident that he could do anything . his teachers told him his grades and his intellect would get him into any college he applied to , and when they en ##ume ##rated several examples one of them was the university of chicago . chicago was the city of his father and where his uncle , whose only contact was a christmas gift mail ##ed to him each december , still lived . the older he got the more he felt the absence of a father in his life . it was like a hollow ##ness growing inside him , not pain but the absence of a sense of complete ##ness . he applied , was accepted , and at age eighteen found himself a student at the university of chicago .	0

sure i would . i will try to keep in touch and let you know what happened on the job situation . " great , it was good meeting you , " said jake , extending his right hand . " thanks for everything , i ' ll talk to you soon . " ricky opened the car door and stepped out onto the curb . he gathered his luggage from the back seat , then said goodbye to jake . he felt as if jake had become a new friend , and he had intentions of trying to stay in contact with him . jake seemed to be a really good person . things seemed to be looking up , he thought , for a change . chapter 2 ricky checked out of the hotel around 7 : 00 ##am on that friday morning . after breakfast , he headed down l street on foot to his home office around the corner on k . presenting his company identification at the security desk , he asked the guard to see robert moran , his boss . hanging up from the call to moran ' s office , the guard pointed to an elevator , and instructed ricky to proceed to the third floor . when the elevator door opened on the third floor , a very attractive receptionist at the front desk greeted him . " he ' s on the phone right now , " she said . " i ' ll let him know you are here when he hangs up . " thanks , " replied ricky , settling into one of the big reception chairs . it had been a while since ricky had been at the home office . his assignment in atlanta , as lead accountant ,	actually working for moran , he replaced a man who had recently resigned . changes to old policies by the new investors were the cause of many resignation ##s at the plant during that time . this previously family owned business quickly turned in a new direction . ricky was directed to set up a separate , and very secret , set of books just to monitor offshore bank account transactions in belize . there was a separate corporation in belize as well , connected directly to the atlanta based company . moran was funnel ##ing money into and out of the firm in atlanta by making wire transfers to and from belize . the balance ##s in belize , were from various governments , even the state department , and different firms all over the world . as far as ricky was concerned , none of them passed the smell test but he did as he was told . the recent bankruptcy of the atlanta based firm was con ##tri ##ved from what ricky could g ##lean from the books . successful in the past , the firm had a good potential but was held back recently by this new group of investors .	0

another approach may be to re ##lo ##ok at the methodology of bu ##khar ##i and muslim . they are humans and had ##ith scholars have on many occasion disagreed with them . one example of many – when bu ##khar ##i took his work to the leading scholars of his time , they told him that they agreed with all but four of his had ##ith compilation . had ##ith compiler ##s continued their work long after bu ##khar ##i and muslim again indicating they were not the final end - all - be - all of had ##ith compilation . yet our so - called ul ##ema continue to sell the idea to the muslim public that muslim and bu ##khar ##i are final and to disagree is b ##las ##ph ##emy . it is as if that there is one islam for had ##ith scholars and another for the muslim public at large . this is manifest evil for any whose hearts can see . let me then expand on a re - thinking scheme . now , al sha ##fi ’ i notes the criteria for sa ##hi ##h in the following way : " each reporter should be trust ##worthy in his religion ; he should be known to be truth ##ful in his na ##rra ##ting , to understand what he na ##rra ##tes , to know how a different expression can alter the meaning , and report the word ##ing of the had ##ith verb ##ati ##m , not only its meaning . this is because if he does not know how a different expression can change the whole meaning , he will not know if he has changed what is lawful into what is prohibited . “ hence , if he reports the had ##ith according to its word ##ing , no change of meaning will be found at all . moreover , he should be a good memo ##rize ##r if he happens to report from his memory , or a good preserve ##r of his writings if he happens to report from them . he should agree with the narration ##s of the huff ##az ( leading authorities in had ##ith ) , if he reports something which they do also . he should not be a mud ##all ##is , who na ##rra ##tes from someone he met about something he did not hear , nor should he report from the prophet ( may allah bless him and grant him peace ) contrary to what reliable sources have reported from him .	the train was slowly moving through the city passing many intersections . coincidentally , moss was sitting at a railroad crossing having gotten lost trying to find his friends place of business . steve for a brief moment saw a motor home towing a range rover and both moss and steve held eye contact for a fraction of a second .	1

while earth - america vision ##aries did not use traditional biblical and theological imagery — scratching biblical terms out and writing over them with secular and scientific terms — they effectively translated the meanings and expressed the core values of the lone male biblical tradition of dominion . here lay the origins of earth - america ’ s globalization vision — in my coinage , that of the “ earth ##pe ##ople . ” earth ##pe ##ople what changed in the conversation after the mushroom cloud and earth ##rise events was that most people accepted that we humans are one species — earth ’ s people . it became widely accepted that all humans are part of the web of life that is unique to the blue marble . however , this web of life only described a biological truth . it did not call forth a new myth ##ic story of origin . humans remained mother ##less children .	” were activists engaged in a range of social justice and social service movements . they were , for instance , green , into native american spirituality , anti - racist and anti - sex ##ist — good people doing good for others . but as i engaged them , i described them as earth ##pe ##ople and not earth ##folk mainly because they expressed the biblical at ##hei ##sm that denies the existence of a mother . for them mother earth was a metaphor , not a living presence . they were , it was painful to point out , acting out dominion without owning up to doing so — a lone male one - body trait . they were the latest evolution of the lone male vision and value system . they sought dominion over the earth although they were claiming that they were making the earth “ flat ” — doing away with the old hi ##era ##rch ##al ( some would even say old patriarch ##al ) systems on every front . they advocated globalization in the way i had initially advocated resistance to the war , that is , through non ##vio ##lent dominion . in the main , my campus for ##ays revealed that the first phase of the globalization movement was being guided by this earth ##pe ##ople vision and value set . telling ##ly , these lone male earth ##pe ##ople could not see their own shadow . while among themselves they argued about and advocated sustainability or being green or creating a more socially just global society or even maintaining a non ##vio ##lent peace - keeping force , they failed to grasp that the core of their message was still that someone is the enemy , someone is other , that there are goo ##ks , somewhere . they per ##pet ##uated a static black - and - white dual ##ism that at its base sustained the belief that humans are mother ##less children . although most were not directly involved with military institutions or projects , when pressed	0

then he gave a loud whistle and the mel ##on men began running towards them to get clear . when they were safely back behind them , simon gestured down the clearing . “ go on , try . ” rook ##wood lifted the rifle to his shoulder but paused as simon stepped closer , tapping at his feet with a shoe until they were the width of his shoulders apart , pressing the butt firmly into his shoulder . when he was satisfied he waved down the clearing to indicate the mel ##ons . rook ##wood slid his finger through the trigger guard and fired . the crack startled him . the recoil forced him to take a step back . the ejected cartridge spun away onto the grass . the mel ##ons hung und ##ist ##urbed in the limp air . he heard them s ##nig ##ger ##ing behind his back but forced himself to keep looking down the makeshift range . he rocked to check his footing again , then aimed and fired . nothing . rook ##wood fired a third and fourth time . nothing . someone behind him said something he didn ’ t understand . rook ##wood braced again , took careful aim through the v of the sight and squeezed the trigger gently . as the rifle buck ##ed he glimpse ##d a splash of red and a green chunk flew off a mel ##on . juice dr ##ib ##bled . he tried to hide a smile as a cheer broke out behind	he wanted to put two hands on the boy ’ s shoulders and look deep into his eyes . he wanted to say , “ you can get clear of this , ” but he did not . louise always put pop into the cooler that he left by the door . the boy stood , carefully folding the paper , while mu ##nson got out two cold bottles of coke , opening them on the bottle opener along the side of the work ##ben ##ch . he always got the old kind , glass bottles , whenever he could find them . and now he placed the cold surface of the glass into the palm of the boy ’ s waiting hand . “ come on out back , ” he said , and the two of them walked to the far end of the shed . mu ##nson slid the old door open to the backyard where the garden patches stretched out into the dim light and the two of them stood and drank quietly , working the cool fluid down into their bodies with the sounds of swallowing making the only ripple ##s upon the air to be heard . “ you come here for dinner tomorrow night . ” the boy looked at him . “ no , i don ’ t think so . it wouldn ’ t be right . ” “ you come , ” he said into the quiet air .	1
i ’ m willing to do anything for you . ” he had tears in his eyes when he said those words . it really melted my heart . i reached over and hugged him . tears started to flow down my cheeks . yet somehow , i managed to compose myself . i stepped back and da ##bbed my eyes with a ke ##rch ##ie ##f . “ robbie , look at me . let me tell you something . i know you well enough to be aware of what you ’ re really like . you wouldn ’ t be happy working like a farm hand . you want to ride horses , be a cavalry officer , travel the world , live in a manor home , have valet ##s and servants at your beck and call . and you should lead the good life . you deserve it . you are used to it . just think about losing it all . you will come to res ##ent me for it . ” “ so you won ’ t come with me ? ” “ robbie ! as much as i want to , i ’ m thinking about your future life . ” “ no ! i don ’ t want such a life . what good are those comfort ##s without you ?	the only one i love , puppet . ” saying this , he rushed out of the cabin . i imagine he didn ’ t wish me to see him crying . i started to run after him , but stopped at the door . it was as if my legs were in chains and i could go no further . i tried to shout after him , yes , yes , robbie , let ’ s saddle up right now and gallo ##p off towards charleston . however , the words would not come out . robert mounted babu ##r and gallo ##ped away . i watched him until he disappeared into the woods . i went back inside the cabin and sat down on the bench . with my elbows on the table and my head between my hands , i cried my heart out . did i make the right decision , i wondered ? dear god , have i lost him forever ? i slept badly that night . as a result , i woke up a bit late the next day . remembering that betty , the upstairs maid , was feeling poorly and would not be at work , i decided to tidy up before leaving the room . as my room was next door to my aunt and uncle ’ s bedroom , we shared an adjoining wash ##room . after washing up , i cleaned in there , emptied the wash ##bas ##in , and brought up fresh water in the jug . i was making the bed when i heard the customary knock on the wash ##room door on the side	0
with everyone awake , they ate quickly and read ##ied themselves and the cart for continuing the journey . as lu ##it ##gard he ##fted one of the bags of fabric onto the wagon , the man walked close to her and spoke in quiet tones . " i have a request for you , " he said . " my daughter saw your fabrics yesterday and quite likes them . i don ' t have enough money to buy any from you but i was hoping you might be kind enough to give her even a small square as a precious . " he added quickly , " i will gladly wave any fee for the ride . " lu ##it ##gard was not sure if he was offering a good deal but the sentimental request struck her . she nodded and reached into the bag she had just placed upon the wagon . she pulled out a corner of the fabric but was not sure how to cut it . then , remembering the dagger tied beneath her shaw ##l , she reached for it .	carving knife . " use this , " he said , not realizing she had been about to reach for the dagger . she nodded in thanks and took the offered knife , her heart beating powerful ##ly as she realized she had nearly revealed her hidden weapon to justin who stood only a few steps away . she had not realized how quickly she could return to the old habit of trusting those around her . she needed to be more careful . she cut a swat ##ch not much bigger than her hand and gave it to the man . " i can give you no more , " she said . he nodded and took the fabric . " thank you for this , " he said . " i ' m sure my daughter will clutch to it for the rest of her life . she wishes she were born a princess or a noble ##woman with fancy clothes . this is the best i can offer but it is more than i could a day ago . " he thanked her once more and walked away . not long later , they were all back on the wagon and reaching ever closer to stare me ##sto . chapter 8 since lu ##it ##gard had left them , it seemed the village had had to make surprisingly few adjustments to their daily routine . while the lessons she had once taught were taken over by different cr ##ones , the day to day supervision and decision making had fallen to ada ##lb ##ern and si ##eg ##lind ##e , who had managed quite successfully to maintain the efficient status quo . every morning , si ##eg ##lind ##e would steal some rolls from the kitchens and take them to the men on the walls . most mornings , hum ##bert was there and she would give him	0

" oh , my word , " kelly muttered . she was staring . dean saw nothing but jackson and the car , with the porter loading the trunk . " what is it ? " he asked . she shot him a glance .	0

and simon works furiously to catch up . they have adapted amazingly quickly to abandon the expected instinct ##ive traits they should have inherited . their appetite for learning is vo ##rac ##ious . their predecessor , the infant doesn ’ t appear to be showing any deviation yet , but unlike his kin he is truly only weeks old . the next human ‘ twins ’ are also on the fast mat ##uration track and are taller than adam and simon , even though they are much younger , relatively speaking . the alien indication that they will ultimately grow to between nine and eleven feet looks valid . their brain capacity is greater than that of adam , and they can already sustain conversations which include abstract concepts . they are extremely promising individuals , and we ’ ve had to separate them from adam and simon because they are being held back and get frustrated . they have been named loft ##y and tree ##top . i can ’ t report any negative aspect regarding their behaviour and i ’ m constantly testing this out . if the vial the prime ##des refer to as the perfect specimen is a further dot on the graph , and in the anticipated direction , we may be very surprised by its potential . i do however have to remind everyone that this vial is based on ne ##ander ##thal dna , and our expectations should not be rigid ##ly optimistic . ” before harley could art ##iculate his question , christophe jumped the queue . “ what about the pure alien dna or prime ##des as you keep referring to them ? ” newton looked at harley , who shook his head , and christophe challenged him . “ yes , that ’ s what i	notice also that in revelation 8 : 3 the golden altar was “ before the throne ” , which is behind the veil .

a long story . " i hadn ' t done anything , not really . " i ' ve got all night , " tay ##vis answered . " only if you feed her , " will said . " did you know she gets really crank ##y when she hasn ' t been fed ? " " what would you know about it ? " they kept up the ban ##tering argument all the way to the eating area . i didn ' t listen . i was too focused on tay ##vis ' hand , warm around mine . enormous platt ##ers of food covered every table . men in green lounge ##d everywhere , laughing and singing , eating and drinking . robin himself lord ##ed over the festivities . he beamed , his smile stretching from ear to ear . marian sat next to him , smiling like a queen at her subjects . even a blind man could see robin was head over heels in love with her . robin dragged me into the spotlight despite my efforts to stay in the background . i retreated to the shadows as soon as possible . tay ##vis followed . " you want to tell me now ? " he sat near me in the shadowy woods . " there isn ' t much to tell . " " tell me anyway . " tay ##vis poured a cup of sweet juice , handing it to me . i sipped . i	that you miss almost everything almost all the time and act like you get almost everything all the time , you will light ##en up . you naturally will forget that you miss almost everything almost all the time , and when you remember that you do , you will let go of all sorts of things and smile or giggle more and frown less , or appear serious less often . you simply can ’ t approach what your real treasure is , seriously . digging your way there takes too long and won ’ t turn out well . learning your way there is a bit like digging : it won ’ t work either . notice how you hold to “ the truth ” which is anything that you think in the moment . loosen your grip on the truth ; consider that “ the truth ” might be only one possible truth of many . in fact , imagine that what is the truth to you at this moment might not be the truth to you in the next moment . people used to think the world was flat ; in fact , they were convinced of it . ancient medicine used to greatly value lee ##ches as a tool for heath . personally i have only had a couple of lee ##ches on me and , believe me , i didn ’ t feel any better about any aspect of life until i got them off and the places	1
of ancient times used papyrus reed ##s cut into strips and placed horizontally to dry . once dry , more papyrus strips were laid at right angles and glued in place . finally , after polish ##ing , the paper was ready to use . writing was with the grain . when writing on both sides of the paper , as with the scroll , the writing on one side would be written at a ninety degree angle when compared to the opposite side due to the grain of the paper . whoever reads the scroll would have to , at times , turn it ninety degrees to understand it . the writing on both the front and back of the scroll is similar to the way information about the revealing of christ is given to us in the book of revelation . we have to look at revelation from a different angle , a different perspective , if we are to understand its meaning . the book of revelation is like a stereo ##gram picture , a picture hidden within a picture . on the surface it paints an image of war , famine , death , and destruction . but when we change our focus , we will see the hidden picture , one of christ manifested within his people . a large part of the book of revelation involves seven sets of symbols . each set has seven elements presented in a seemingly logical , numerical order . since the information contained within each set of symbols is given to us in an apocalyptic writing style , when we read the chapters containing these sets of symbols and their corresponding elements , we have a story about death and destruction . when we look at the book in this traditional , well - organized way , it is hard to miss ‘ the surface picture . ’ to see the hidden picture that reveals christ in his people , we need to see the elements of the different set of symbols in a new way . the first element of each set , the first seal removed , the first trumpet blown , the first angel flying through heaven , and so forth , when grouped together , show us christ in the people of the first church whose focus is ‘ salvation . ’ when we consider the second element of each set of symbols , we see that they describe expressions of christ working in the people of the second church , whose focus is learning and teaching the scriptures . the third elements of the seven sets of symbols , when joined together as a container of information , show us the focus of the third church . in this way , the sets of symbols and their elements piece together in a way that show christ manifested	the seven seals opened the focus of each church after the letters to the seven churches , we see god sitting on a throne .	0
in the earliest editions of the prayer book was already evident . the order for the visitation of the sick in the 1926 book placed considerably less emphasis upon suffering as a visitation from god ##1 although sickness was still seen as a means by which he “ correct ##s ” his children . 1 ##ex ##hort ##ation , 154 ##9 , 155 ##2 , 1662 , “ where ##for ##e , whatsoever your sick ##enes ##s is , know you certainly , that it is god ’ s visitation ” 2 ##ex ##hort ##ation , 1926 , “ our heavenly father , in his love for all men uses sickness as a gr ##acious means whereby to correct his children . ” a positive approach is seen throughout the provision in the 2004 prayer book . for example , the pre - san ##ctus in the eu ##cha ##rist ##ic prayer ( p . 44 ##3 - 4 ) lays stress on the goodness of god in creation and redemption , we give you thanks , our god and father , for you have created us and you sustain us . through your only son jesus christ you have revealed your love and your care for all your people ; you are ready to forgive and to save in time of need ; so we pro ##claim your glory . . . in the provision for the laying on of hands on p . 44 ##7 it is made clear that the purpose for this is for healing , both in the rub ##ric and in the accompanying prayer , and the example of the healing ministry of christ is explicitly referred to , in the name of our lord jesus christ who laid his hands on the sick that they might be healed , i lay my hands upon you . . . may almighty god , father , son , and holy spirit make you whole in body ,	am ##en . similarly in the form on p . 44 ##8 for an ##oint ##ing with oil , the form of consecration says , “ san ##ct ##ify this oil for the healing of the sick ” and pray ##s that those who received this ministry may , “ by the power of the holy spirit be made whole ” . the scripture passage chosen is that from the ep ##istle of james which refers to the elders of the church praying over the sick person , an ##oint ##ing him with oil in the name of the lord ; “ and the prayer of faith will save the sick man , and the lord will raise him up , and if he has committed any sins he will be forgiven . ” and the minister says that in continuing this ministry with the laying on of hands and an ##oint ##ing the prayer will be that the lord “ will grant healing and restoration and forgiveness according to his loving and gr ##acious will .	0

simply because women love great and horrible stories . some women will do just about anything as long as they are not directly involved or affected by the situation . these women are usually helpful in organizing a bunch of women for group dinners , beach parties and other activities with only a few guys who draw the attention of other women .	type of man , thinking these guys are cool to be in the middle of such attention . now that we know the cold approach as well as a pawn , let ’ s take a look at the subtle approach . this type of approach takes into consideration the environment , points of contact with the chosen woman , interrupt ##ible factors , and environmental hazards that might hind ##er your chances at a successful contact and conversation . the first thing to do is , again , know what you want to say before you approach her . let ’ s say she ’ s at a bus stop , you ’ ll get the chance to possibly sit with her for an entire bus ride . assess the situation carefully before proceeding . a woman who is dressed class ##y , stands firm , and well put together is usually intelligent and confident . she does not need self - validation . these women are best approached with a question , a comment on something affecting not just her , or asking their opinion on something . she is accustomed to the usual walk up approach and compliment ##s , “ how you doing ? hi beautiful ” etc . you need to strike a real interest - point , and conversation that is not cl ##iche , or another annoying distraction . a good tactic is to walk over and ask if she ’ s been to the bus stop for a long time . she will probably respond , “ no , not really i ’ ve been here about five minutes ” and you can respond , “ great , that means the bus will soon be here . thank you , i ’ m james , ” and she will most likely respond with her name or say , “ nice to meet you , james ” and you can then ask her name or say one of a million things . do not ask where she ’ s going or anything too personal . you can ask just about anything socially widespread in the news you can think of and she will respond . always ask an open ended question that sparks discussion . always say “ what do you think about … ” this approach is similar to the cold approach , but with more attention on social factors , rather than just walking over and talking . it is a more analytical approach designed to show more intelligence and genuine interest in quality conversation . if you get a negative response , just say , “	0

one woman cried and hugged my torso when i opened the door . i gave her a minute to calm down before leading the people to the impromptu exit , gently speaking calming words to her . no injuries were greater than a few cuts and bruises . as i guided the group out , i noticed two large holes gaping in the ceiling of the bar . debris lay about the floor under the holes . once they were safely out , i spent more time looking around inside , in case someone was unconscious and unable to call for help . after minutes of walking around the ruined bar , i couldn ' t find anyone else remaining inside . as i climbed back out through my rough exit , i coughed again . i ’ d never considered the mess the debris from a building would make . several more small flashes went off as i stood outside the gaping wound into the building . i dust ##ed off what i could from my clothes , face , arms and hair when i walked toward the officers . at least the claw marks had stopped bleeding , though the gas ##hes looked nasty . the officers listened to the stories from numerous people . it appeared that everyone was accounted for , barr ##ing the small man that fled .	she just landed at the phoenix airport . she has a room in the city and will probably be here tomorrow . ” ivan didn ’ t need to give a name . marcus knew she was coming . he had peered over her shoulder , invisible to her , when she arranged the flight . the woman was a wealth of surprises . she had sensed him in the small apartment with her . she ’ d stopped and looked around feeling the une ##asi ##ness at his presence , a presence she shouldn ’ t have recognized . good thing she hadn ’ t figured out it was a who , not what , that made her app ##re ##hen ##sive . he ’ d shuddered at the thought of her reaction if she realized he searched her apartment , and could describe the color of every pair of panties in the top drawer of her dresser . she was st ##aid on the outside , with sexy thong ##s hidden beneath ugly suits . marcus knew he had to stop thinking of the woman ’ s linger ##ie , stop remembering the feel of the silk against his fingers , stop remembering her scent . it was driving him crazy . good thing he ’ d left her apartment before she ’ d stripped for bed . the temptation would have been too great . “ ivan , send mary to my room . ” * * * as mary tentatively entered the bedroom , marcus didn ’ t even give her a chance to approach the bed . he was on her	1
the point see ##rn ##s to be that the une ##nl ##ight ##ened cannot fully perceive the flower as it really is , cannot experience it directly and purely . instead it is approached as an object apart from the viewer , the subject . it is not seen as an extension of his or her own reality . the ordinary mind permits this di ##cho ##tom ##y of nature , but in the zen mind , man and flower become one , merged into a seam ##less fabric of life . this is the kind of statement that in later years would be isolated from the chronicles and made into a " public case " or ko ##an , a teaching device for novice ##s . its meaning is not meant to be disc ##ern ##ed through the logical processes , and even less through the medium of language . when a later master was asked what nan - ch ' ua ##n had meant , he answered with the equally enigma ##tic " pass me a brick . " 5 the other celebrated story about the governor is perhaps easier to understand . the story says that one day lu hs ##uan posed the following problem to nan - ch ' ua ##n : " what if i told you that a man had raised a goose in a bottle , watching it grow until one day he realized that it had grown too large to pass through the bottle ' s neck	not want to break the bottle or kill the goose , how would he get it out ? " nan - ch ' ua ##n began quietly , " my esteem ##ed governor , " and then he shouted , " the goose is out ! " the story says that lu hs ##uan suddenly was en ##light ##ened on the spot . 6 nan - ch ' ua ##n had shown that one who posed a hypothetical question could be answered by an equally hypothetical response . there is a common ch ' an ( and tao ##ist ) reference to a truth being caught in the net of words . here nan - ch ' ua ##n shows how to extract truth from verbal en ##cum ##bra ##nce ##s . another an ##ec ##dote recounts a similar incident : a monk said to nan - ch ' ua ##n , " there is a jewel in the sky ; how can we get hold of it ? " nan - ch ' ua ##n said , " cut down bamboo ##s and make a ladder , put it up in the sky , and get hold of it ! ' ' the monk said , " how can the ladder be put up in the sky ? " nan - ch ' ua ##n said , " how can you doubt your getting hold of the jewel ? " 7 many of his finest exchanges with pupils are preserved in the transmission	0

somebody had hauled away the bodies i had left in the living room . in their ste ##ad a nervous young man stood by the kitchen entrance holding a saw ##ed off shotgun . he was watching me with wide eyes as enrique rodriguez loomed over me , grinning . i tried to take a swing at fat mexican , but the ropes had me pinned . i kicked him in the groin , instead . enrique jumped back with a ye ##lp , holding onto his crotch and groaning . as he bent over i saw a patch of blood - soaked ga ##uze taped to the top of his skull . tanya had done a good job with the bat . just not good enough . " i ' ll kill you , man . "	##na ##ke i had seen earlier stuck its head out of a mouse hole and flicked at the air with its red tongue . it was getting the same bad vibrations from enrique as i was . " i ' m impressed , enrique , " i qui ##pped , keeping an eye on the snake ' s head . " no matter what side of the garbage pile you crawl out of , you ' ve got the same stink . " he cocked his arm and started toward me , but caught himself when the front door banged . a moment later delaney waltz ##ed into the kitchen . the big cop was sweating and red - faced except for the scars on his cheek . those stood out like writhing white worms . " did the son - of - a - bitch talk ? " delaney roared at enrique . " nice to see you ' re still with us , delaney , " i interrupted . " i ' ve been keeping an eye on a relative of yours . he ' s hiding in that mouse hole below the stove . cute little fellow — has fangs and a rattle . " " i just got started , man , " enrique told the big cop . " and then the son - of - a - bitch kicked my balls , man . " " enrique ' s been telling me how he ' s cut his own deal with the porte ##llo ##s . according to him , you ' ve been dropped from the program . " delaney looked from me to enrique but said nothing . " he ' s full of shit , man . " enrique retreated a step , scar ##ing the snake back into it dark domain . the mexican pointed a threatening finger at me . " i ' m gonna ' make you pay for that , man .

you un ##fe ##elin ##g bastard .	tried , believe me . but i ' m afraid she was far past listening to me . by then she was learning the ke ##k ##chi maya dialect , becoming totally immersed in their world . she began having episodes of complete non - rational ##ity , and then one day she told the women in her compound she was going over to pale ##n ##que , the maya ruins in mexico . it ' s where the classical maya held their last kings ##hip ceremony . before anyone realized she was serious , she stole one of their ca ##yu ##cos , their mahogany dug ##out canoe ##s , and headed down the rio ti ##gre . " his eyes had turned completely dark , the way he used to blank them out . " she just went missing . everyone here was devastated . we all loved her . " i stood there weighing his story . it didn ' t ring true . i supposed she was capable of something that crazy , but would she have actually done it ? i didn ' t think so . then i remembered something else he ' d said . " you said you proposed an ' agreement . ' what was that about ? " he stared at me . " it ' s nothing that need concern us . su ##ffi ##ce to say i kept my part . anyway , it ' s over and past now . " why wouldn ' t he tell me ? did she make some bargain with the devil ? " but regarding sarah , " he went on , " i only just learned she ' d been found and brought to new york in a coma . wanting to do what i could , i immediately called the hospital and , out of professional courtesy , they told me she ' d shown early stages of coming out of it , but she appeared to be hall ##uc ##inating . it was exactly what i ' d feared . . . . " his voice trailed off . " i hope i did the right thing , but when i learned she ' d been released , i arranged for her to be brought back here , where perhaps i can do something for her . " " what ?

“ yes i think so , emperor , i have several computers in my castle as well as many phones , but all our phones are not working at all .	the main computer in my throne room . ” “ can you take us there ? ” asked fa ##mar ##on . “ please follow , ” said ve ##ata as she motioned with her right hand in a quick swirl and then started walking across the street . everyone followed close behind with fa ##mar ##on walking beside her . they crossed the brown marble street and up to the front gates of free ##si ##d . the 2 red headed female guards opened the gates and ve ##ata smiled at them and said happily , ” thank you co ##rle ##tt and ba ##ur ##p . you ’ re doing a great job . ” then as they walked across the draw ##bridge the sky filled with wo ##right ##s , pen ##ip ##odes , and flash ##ers that were blasting away at each other . “ quickly inside everyone ! ” shouted rat ##ie as she pushed fa ##mar ##on and ve ##ata forward . then everyone ran the 35 feet across and into the castle courtyard . there were 2 dozen guards most of which were female , standing about the courtyard wearing black leather body suits and they had laser pistols on their hips . there was a pair of yellow water fountains on either side that had statues of ve ##ata in the nude holding a sword in one hand and a knife in the other . the front doors to the main castle were shaped like a wa ##ffle and made from brown wood , with a he ##xa ##gon shaped golden door handle . “ open the main door now ! ” shouted ve ##ata at her guards as she and everyone ran across the courtyard . then above them a pair of flash ##ers got blasted into oblivion , but balls of fiery twisted metal came falling towards the courtyard . the first one care ##ened into the fountains on the right breaking the statue in 2 and sending a fiery trail into the front gate . the second flew head ##long into the side of the castle leaving a large fiery hole . everyone ran into the main castle just as laser fire exploded behind them . then the guard slammed the door shut and everyone released a sigh of relief . then suddenly a laser canon blew the front door to pieces and fa ##mar ##on shouted , ” everyone keep moving further into the castle ! ” they ran into the main living room that was 100 yards long and had 70 foot high ceilings . it had an enormous 35 foot and 10 foot wide brown leather couch that was in the shape of a cross and was in the center of the room . on the left side of the room was a 20	0

again , the magician approached the man and started his ge ##stic ##ulation ##s and his rec ##itation of occult murmurs . little by little , the closed hand began to open as if by some force that could not be seen , but that surely existed . this hidden force was opening the hand and overcoming the strong clenched grip of its owner . the rich man increased the tightening of his hand , calling up all his energies so that he might defeat the invisible force which was ob ##li ##ging his hand to open .	due to the great effort he was ex ##ert ##ing in squeezing his fist closed . he began to feel tired without getting any result from his labor ##s . thus , he failed and his hand became fully open , clearly showing the golden li ##ra . the defiant thief then took the second li ##ra and put it in his pocket with his lips curled into a smile that was filled with gui ##le . his eyes were as dark as the darkness of a pitch - black night and were sending sharp looks out around the room . this was the second li ##ra that he had earned . mr . m a sheikh ##o was carefully watching the situation . he knew well the secret behind the deeds of that magician due to his deep belief in god . he could disc ##ern that the magician had no power except over people who were far from god and who deserved to be overcome . had those men truly resort ##ed to god and sought his protection , the devil ##ish consort ##s would have fled the scene without affecting their spirits . they would not have been able to di ##sable them by making them lose their control of their body ’ s functions , nor would they have been capable of enabling the devil ’ s brother , the magician , to take the li ##ras from their hands which were no longer under the control of their spirits . before the third man put his hand in his pocket and got caught in the hands of this wil ##y thief , as had happened with his friends , and before the magician continued his round of all those present one by one , in accordance with the fox ##y deal which they had all have agreed upon , mr . m a sheikh ##o acted . he was not happy to let that evil magician complete his round of those present , stealing their golden li ##ras , as this was an act that would be di ##sa ##pp ##roved of by anyone who had a free conscience . he turned towards the magician and said to him , “ come on ! i accept your challenge . come here ! i face up to you . ” the magician then left the person whose turn had come and walked towards mr . m a	0

i asked .	they could mark their targets . the arrows hissed and the norse were falling , then all the guards saw the skirmish ##ers and began running away down the slope . ray ##nar slung his bow and w ##his ##ked out his thin short sword . the long ropes were knotted to a log post at each end . ray ##nar did not know this blade . the syrian steel looked too thin to be of use against another sword , but it slashed through that thick ship ' s rope as if it were cheese . there was no time to release each prisoner . the execution ##ers who had escaped the volley of . arrows were yelling to get the attention of the rest of the walking wounded . one by one the wounded were turning away from watching the battle for the valley and looking towards the prisoners . ray ##nar cut the big rope away from the post , and then ran down the line of women to the closest dead body and cut the thick rope at that point . " run ! " he shouted , and pointed up the slope to the gu ##lly and the woods . " run to the woods and wait for the rest ! " the women moved slowly . their bodies were sore from abuse , and if one stumbled , the tug on the rope caused others to fall . " get moving , work together , get moving ! " ray ##nar yelled in frustration . " save yourselves ! oh , please save yourselves ! " wylie had followed ray ##nar ’ s lead and was cutting the thick rope of the next line of women . ray ##nar looked up the slope and could see the other skirmish ##ers working at freeing the hands of the closest men . of course , once the men were freed , they can save the women . once freed , the first of the prisoners searched the fallen norse for blades , and started freeing other men . by the time ray ##nar and wylie had the four strings of women loose , and crawling up the slope , help was on its way . the slow stumble up the slope became a walk and then a tr ##ot as more and more hands were cut free of the ship ' s rope . by the time the prisoners made the gu ##lly , the thick ropes were left behind on the ground . ray ##nar heard a warning from what sounded like here ##ward ' s voice , so he turned . a mass of the walking wounded , armed with swords and daggers , but no shields , was closing in on him . ray ##nar and wylie dragged the last of the slower women up the slope until they had reached the start of the gu ##lly . here ##ward and most of the skirmish ##ers joined them there	1
a well balanced healthy diet , without doubt also plays an important role . for me the most important component is one ' s attitude and mood . i think remaining cheerful is paramount and staying positive no matter what , is number one on my list . apart from physical health , mental health is of equal importance , and keeping busy , opt ##omi ##stic , staying social , laughing and accepting changes w ##his ##lt making the most out of your life is what i preach . i wish the “ happy gene ” i have been blessed with , were con ##tag ##ious , i would in ##fect everyone i come into contact with ! larger print – december 16th 2011 i visited a very dear lady today who lives in a retirement village , and i ' m not quite sure who enjoys the weekly visits more , myself or the lady ! we are never short of conversation , she is always good company with interesting stories to tell , and we have a good laugh together . however today she made me realise for the first time , that often it ' s difficult for those with poor eyes ##ight to read small print , and i immediately asked if she ' d had a problem reading my book of parkinson ' s poems .	answer , which was " yes " , and so the next re - print of the book , i will endeavour to see if the print can be enlarged . pretty perfect for parkinson ' s – december 18th 2011 i find , as i ' m sure any woman with parkinson ' s will agree , that put ##tting on a necklace or bracelet with tiny clasp ##s is ted ##ious , frustrating and a near impossible feat . having to constantly rely on others to help with the smallest of tasks , when coming across something that can be of help , no matter how small , i wanted to share it with you . i found recently a necklace that can also be worn as a brace ##lt by wrapping it several times around one ' s wrist , made of beads inter ##sper ##ced with little attractive magnet ##s . no clasp ##s required , no fi ##ddling , the string of pretty colours just attache ##s by itself , making it easy to put on and wonderful ##ly easy to remove . this magnetic jewellery comes in several different colours , and immediately i could see its ve ##rs ##iti ##lity - particularly relevant when having little dexter ##ity in ones fingers . time is of the essence – december 19th 2011 in the infinite vast ##ness of time , we are here on earth for a mere fleeting moment , hence we should make each moment count . like a footprint in the sands of time , one generation after another slips away , yet we can all leave a	0

this fact shows that the gospel of john was written some time afterwards . the gospel of matthew the ninth verse of the ninth chapter of the gospel of matthew reads as follows : “ and as jesus passed forth from thence , he saw a man , named matthew , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he sai ##th unto him , follow me . and he arose , and followed him . ” ( matt : 9 - 9 ) now , please pay close attention to this point : if matthew himself wrote these statements , why did he use the name matthew in the third person instead of speaking as matthew himself ? [ if the author of this gospel had been matthew himself , he would have said , “ as i was sitting at the customs place , isa ‘ ala ##ih ##is - sal ##am ’ passed by . when he saw me he told me to follow him , to walk behind him . so i stood up and followed him , walked behind him . ” ] in the gospel of matthew , every speech quoted from isa ‘ ala ##ih ##is - sal ##am ’ is so long that it is impossible to say any one of them at one sitting , at one time .	cl ##am up until larry provided some sort of answer , so he might as well give it a go . with roger saying that the price per share accurately reflected the value of the fraction of the company it represented , this was easy . the total value of the company was nothing more than the price of one share times the number of shares . that would be $ 100 times 10 , 000 , 000 shares , which was a one followed by nine zero ##s or . . . “ one billion dollars ! ” “ bingo ! you ’ re part owner of a billion - dollar business , ” said roger . “ i don ’ t know what bmw is really worth , but large industrial conglomerate ##s are often worth many billions of dollars . so it ’ s not a far - fetch ##ed example . ” “ i get that now , ” said larry , “ but my $ 100 share still doesn ’ t amount to much . ” “ remember a few weeks ago when i said that investments should appreciate in value , generate income , or do both ? ” “ um , sort of , ” said larry , even though he didn ’ t . “ it doesn ’ t matter whether your $ 100 investment represents a big or a small fraction of the company . the only thing that matters is whether it grows and generates income better than if you had invested it in , say , general motors . ” “ didn ’ t they almost go bankrupt a few	1
her heart rose in her chest , beating and pumping with triumphant excitement . she felt a great sense of pride , but more for herself than for holly . just the brief ##est glimpse of her current state proved to even a blind man that she was the true ##st of true warriors , thanks to her . she was gonna have this mu ##tt trained to kill in no time at all . judging by her condition , he must have put up quite a struggle . her makeup was smeared to shit , practically gone . she ' d seen her without her makeup plenty of times before but nothing at all like this ; indications of cuts that had been cleaned up ; her gorgeous brown curls pulled back in a tail and the poor lighting from the hallway outside revealed the coil ##y dirt ##iness that it suffered from the battle ; she stood with her arms crossed , holding her elbows , knees locked together ; shirt and pants on , barefoot . her eyes looked halfway blank ; the other half had something ind ##es ##cr ##iba ##ble in them — something aware , alive and kicking , that was for sure . “ ’ su ##p , by ##aa ##tch ! ” ki ##rsten exclaimed through a whispered shout , followed by a laugh . holly didn ’ t move a muscle . “ what ’ s up ?	to their respective tasks , moving quickly and quietly . br ##ey crept forward along the sea ##ward side , stationed himself next to the line securing the anchor , and waited for a signal . behind him , he could hear the rustling of the forward main ##sai ##l as his chu ##m and mall ##en made ready to ho ##ist her . he could hear the whispered conversation between them as well .

her family and friends . asked him to make better those that were sick . but she never asked for anything for herself apart from protection and guidance . well , there was that one time she asked him to let her win the w . h . smith ’ s win a pony competition , but that was a one off . there was one other prayer and that was for god to send her someone who ’ d love her for all eternity and she in turn would love them . only tonight she drifted off before she could complete it . she slept fit ##fully , nightmare after nightmare . dreams of gina , running from her torment ##or , her ago ##nis ##ing screams piercing the gloom as ramon tore out her soul . even more grotesque , more disturbing , were the dreams of her and ramon , their bodies en ##twined in obscene sexual acts . and no matter how rep ##ulsive those dreams were , they couldn ’ t compare to those depicting the torture and death of women and children , their blood smeared over her naked body in some sort of demonic ritual . lil ##ia went over a pre ##ci ##pic ##e , falling into the dark abyss . harrow ##ing screams bomb ##arded her , engulfed her , piercing her soul until the cries em ##ana ##ted from her . she plunged further , through the slick , oil ##y darkness that sought to dev ##our her . her scream was swallowed by the fall . falling fast , falling deeper , she hit the bottom with a sudden jolt . she sat bolt upright in bed , her senses on full alert as she scanned the apartment for anything ami ##ss , her hand seeking the . 38 s ##nu ##b - nose she kept under her pillow . just a dream she reassured herself as an ir ##re ##press ##ible ya ##wn con ##tort ##ed her face . by the shafts of light streaming through the room it was time to get up , but that didn ’ t stop her from s ##nu ##gg	she flinched as the doorbell ##s shrill chi ##me pierced the ser ##enity of the room . fling ##ing the covers off she scrambled out of bed , win ##cing as her head began to th ##ro ##b . “ who the hell ’ s this ? ” she padded down the hall to the door , flicked on the security monitor and stood staring at the face peering back at her . louis , the guys from ramon ’ s apartment , was , without a doubt , the most handsome man she ’ d ever laid eyes on , on the down side , he was also extremely intimidating . how had he found her and , more importantly , what did he want ? she took a deep breath in an attempt to soothe her chaotic thoughts .	0
magnolia ##s were very delicate and in order to get them at their peak , mary had called in some favors from the fl ##oris ##t down the street . no one was sure they would last overnight , but tonight they had been glorious . mary returned to the em ##bal ##ming room and fetch ##ed a gurney . rolling it beside the casket , she and joey carefully removed the flowers . “ a brown spot will form everywhere you touch the magnolia blossom , so hang on to the leaves , ” she ordered . together they managed to get the spray on the table with much of the arrangement hanging over both sides . then they wheeled it into cold storage in the em ##bal ##ming room for the night . joey would pile the rest of the flowers under the gurney . mary returned to her office . on her desk was the message to pick up a homeless man at the mor ##gue . she ’ d leave all that for tomorrow when mike could help her go over the plots in the potter ’ s field . although they had gone into the computer age , mary still relied on mike ’ s memory to tell her where the graves actually were , especially in potter ’ s field . teens often stole the fl ##im ##sy markers . she ran a comb through her short brown hair and tried to hide a few gray ##s that were popping out on the sides . “ not getting any younger , ” she said to herself . “ cheer up . forty - eight is not that bad . you still look good . ” she grabbed her purse and reached for her coat . she was looking forward to finally getting out of her blue dress and relaxing in her pajamas . then she heard the front door open again as sam and mike came in , yelling her name . “ something ’ s going on in the cemetery	mike heard a scream , and i saw some lights . van ##dal ##s ! damn teenagers ! ” sam ho ##ller ##ed . “ still got your gun ? ” mary poked her head out of her office and into the hall where sam stood . “ gun ? are you crazy ? i gave it back to preston after last year ’ s nasty business . remember , i killed a man with it . i have no intention of doing it again ! ” mary ’ s gun was actually in her desk drawer , but she wasn ’ t going to hand it over to sam and mike . these guys were out of control . sam frowned . “ get a flashlight then . we should have a company gun , mary . i ’ ll put it in the budget . ” “ no , you won ’ t , sam ! ” mary protested .	0
i moved to the back of his walk - in closet , hoping he would not get a sense i was there . the closet door had been left slightly open , just enough for me to see . standing at the back of the closet , i had hardly enough time to get my nerves under control when he sa ##unt ##ered into the room . he closed the door behind him and walked straight to his dresser , slowly altering his pace and seeming to sniff the air around him . he behaved like a hound dog sniffing the air for prey .	she welcomed the challenges he presented her . during her orientation at the hotel when he first insisted that she board the ship unveiled , her initial reaction was to protest , but then she saw right through what he was doing , and decided to make it work for herself . if he was going to use her faith to test her dedication to the plan , then so be it . she would use one to strengthen the other . and so far , at least , she found it easier to see the value of her religious pre ##ce ##pts by their absence in the world at large , rather than their h ##yp ##oc ##rit ##ical adherence in her world at home . not all of the tests were faith - based , though . he had orchestrated a dramatic encounter just before they boarded the ship , introducing her to a hulk ##ing troll of a man whom he claimed was a hired killer that would do away with her family if she attempted to betray him or rene ##ge on their deal in any way . the killer did not say a word the whole time , and na ##jah suspected he was just some poor dim ##wi ##t who worked on the docks whom tar ##iq had dressed up in a suit to play the part . although when someone claims owners of shipping companies as colleagues and drops a couple of decades ’ worth of pay on your family ’ s kitchen table , you tend to give them the benefit of the doubt when they also claim to know people who kill for a living . what tar ##iq did not take into account , however , was whether or not na ##jah still cared enough about her family at this point for his threat to res ##onate . they had organized the meeting with that man who raped her , and then took no responsibility for it . he was supposed to be a promising candidate for marriage , primarily because her father worked for him and saw a chance to rise in the social ranks . but of course father presented it to the family in entirely different terms . this man would make a good husband because he was a good muslim , a devout man , a gr ##ieving widow ##er	1

her . she missed her mom and dad , but didn ’ t visit or even call for fear steve would find out or track her down . her ex had enough money and connections that he probably had her parents ’ phones tapped and their house monitored , even though it had been a year since she left him . she knew steve , and he wouldn ’ t rest until he found her . it had been hard enough just getting away from him . until she could buy a new identity and some protection , she was stuck here . hence , the dancing job that kept her up nights . she had thought her dancing days were behind her . at eighteen and at the tail end of her rebellious years , she had spent eight months dancing at the local ti ##tty bar , as her dad had called it with a certain amount of disdain . the money had been good , though , and she ’ d enjoyed it at first , but the way the men had looked at her began to creep her out . then 9 / 11 happened and she felt compelled to serve her country since she wasn ’ t really cut out for anything else , and the dancing had proved to be less g ##lam ##orous than she thought . so she quit the ti ##tty bar and joined the army to be a med ##ic . she figured the army could give her a fresh start , and since her new goal was to be a nurse , becoming an army med ##ic was a win - win . six months later , she met steve , a handsome surgical resident . with dark hair and a body built by the gods , she thought she	coil ##ing the rope they had used to keep from being separated , char ##ka said , “ we don ’ t have time to stand around talking . we still have an hour or more to go . ” “ is that correct ? ” jai ##kus asked h ##ym ##al . the ap ##oth ##eca ##ry nodded . “ where i harvest the re ##age ##nts is still some distance away . ” “ i take it sy ##thal is large ? ” renee ##ke asked . “ larger than re ##ak ##la , ” se ##ward replied . “ much larger . ” h ##ym ##al took the lead as they continued on . skirt ##ing around the ruined ed ##ifice , he maintained a route that took them past many buildings that had fallen in disrepair . when they came to a stone dome rising ten feet out of the ground , lady kate pointed it out to the two springer ##s . “ see , there ? most of sy ##thal lies beneath our feet . ” “ is there a way to reach the areas below ? ” jai ##kus asked .	1
the greek expression e ##is ana ##m ##nes ##in , reflecting an underlying hebrew l ` z ##ik ##kar ##on or its aramaic equivalent has strongly sac ##ri ##fi ##cial con ##not ##ations in the old testament tradition and this implies that in the limited and subordinate sense given above there is , properly speaking , a eu ##cha ##rist ##ic offering . it is " this our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving " . 3 . " lay celebration " a certain amount has been heard in recent years of a demand for " lay " celebration . that this is not inherently impossible is indicated by the widespread agreement that on the prove ##rb ##ial " desert island " where there is no priest the highly temporary christian community could provide for its own sacrament ##al ministry by the choice of one or more among its members to exercise such ministry . more practically and realistic ##ally it may be noted that in the methodist church it has long been possible in certain circumstances for lay celebrations to take place . however difficulties arise where what is en ##vis ##aged is apparently not an altogether exceptional event or even a dire emergency but a regular ministry within the church , and this raises the question of why , if people are to exercise a complete ministry of the word and sacrament , they are not appropriately commissioned to do so .	the fire was so hot if anyone else went inside , they might not come out . one fire ##man decided he would go in and maybe he would get lucky and find the other child or one of the parents . before he was able to come out , the roof collapsed , trapping him inside with all the others . the fire took four lives that night . sonny hung on for almost three days , but infection set in , and on the fourth day after the fire , he died . michael was the only one left . andrew and kim said they would raise him as their own son . the money tony had put away would be used for michael ’ s education and also for expenses he would have when he got older . “ every day kim would talk to michael in hebrew and tell him how god let his family die . she said it was all god ’ s fault . she told michael if god was a loving god he would not have let those things happen to them . she said she would never have anything to do with god again . michael asked kim if god took sonny and mary beth . she said he did and it was not right . michael wanted to know how god took them . “ kim said , ‘ god used a fire to burn them and that caused them to die . ” “ michael would always say , ‘ fire is bad , god	1
not to mention that people don ’ t scream and shout at you . they just smile and say “ have a nice day ” or the cultural equivalent . i stood and walked toward the street . i knew should try to sell one of the diamonds before i went much further with my adventures , but i had somebody i needed to track down . i saw the very person i was looking for before i got to the edge of the park — the rick ##shaw boy . and i thought i never had any good luck . he la ##zed beside a row of parked motor ##bi ##kes . when i climbed into his cab , he jumped to his feet . “ where to — ” he did a double take . “ hey , get the hell out of there . ” my disguise was wasted on him . “ the price of a trip must be someone tall and tattooed , ” i said . “ perhaps you will consider this as a substitute . ” i held up a small diamond between thumb and fore ##finger . i would rather have offered him paper money . this little diamond was enough to buy him , his ancient motorcycle and several of his relatives , but one does what one must . it flashed fire in the morning sun . “ what do you think that piece of glass is going to buy you ? ” he sneered . “ a little conversation worth less than a piece of glass , ” i said to him . “ what is conversation but a little air from the lungs ? ” i could almost hear the foul language bubbling up in his mind , but his doubt seemed to beat it back . when a di ##sr ##ep ##utable looking american offers you a chip of glass , it ’ s worth the benefit of some doubt . maybe . he hesitated . above him i saw a long , long , long gray cloud drift over the city . a spark of lightning flashed from the leading edge . “ perhaps we could have this conversation over in the park , ” i said . “ someplace secluded . ” i needed to get out of sight and under the trees seemed to quick ##est bet . “ get out of my rick ##shaw , ” he said . i sighed . “ allow me to show you a family heir ##lo ##om , ” i said and pulled grandfather ’ s sword out of my bag . the rick ##shaw boy ’ s eyes got big but so did those of the bo ##de ##ga clerk who saw me through the store window . the clerk grabbed the phone and it wasn ’	police . “ you ’ re going to cut off my head in public ? ” the rick ##shaw boy ’ s eyes darted left and right .	0

nathan had gone against the entire pack , and the alpha power , to make his way back to per ##dit ##a . “ don ’ t you hang around with some fifth years ? ” a boy with shocking ##ly curly , black hair asked me . his eyes were wide with innocence , but my anger rose , nonetheless , and i wasn ’ t sure why . a trickle of sweat rolled down my back as they all stared at me , waiting for an answer . it was only then that i realised people were as interested in me as they were in nathan . in such a small location , new people were the hot topic . we would likely be the new kids the entire time we attended the school . suppress ##ing a sigh , i nodded . “ my brother and his girlfriend . mostly . ” “ i heard aaron han ##nig ##an asked you out , ” said a petite girl with short , brown hair . “ nah , ” i made a face . “ he tries to ir ##rita ##te my brother is all . ” “ we saw your brother box the living daylight ##s out of aaron , ” she said with a grin . “ best . day . ever . ” i looked away , embarrassed . nathan ’ s wild behaviour that day had horrified me because my own temper kept trying to reveal itself for little reason . that morning , i had snapped at some boy for tipping off my arm . he had backed away in alarm , and something inside me felt pride at his action . it felt right to assert myself over him and to win .	“ where are you from again ? ” ge ##r asked and smiled reassuring ##ly at me , and i tried to feel comfortable . questions didn ’ t bother me as much as my fear of blur ##ting out something important but very private . “ all over , ” i said , shrug ##ging . “ spent most of the last few years in england , so i suppose i consider myself english really . doesn ’ t really matter to me . ” “ that ’ s so cool , ” the brown - haired girl said breath ##ily . i exchanged a be ##mus ##ed glance with ge ##r and had to bite my lip to stop myself from laughing . “ sorry about your grandmother , ” a quiet boy in the corner said . everyone at the table seemed surprised that he spoke at all , and i stared at him with interest .	0

annual production between the pre ##war years of 1935 and 1939 . in contrast , europe and east asia were economically shattered . the united states held most of world ' s investment capital , industrial production and exports . in 1945 , it produced half the world ' s coal , two - thirds of the oil , and more than half of the electricity power . it held 80 percent of the world ' s gold reserves . the united states started with initial economic advantage , consolidated it during and after the war and assumed leadership of the capitalist world . before world war ii , the world had been economically dominated by britain . after the war , the united states became the leading economic power . a devastated britain had little choice . two world wars had destroyed the country ' s principal industries that paid for the import of half the nation ' s food and nearly all its raw materials except coal . the british had no choice but to ask for aid . in 1945 , the united states agreed to a loan of $ 3 . 8 billion in return for market access and trade concessions . charles de gaulle , the french president and the leading voice of french nationalism , was forced to gr ##ud ##gingly ask the united states for a billion dollar loan . in return france promised to curt ##ail government subsidies and currency manipulation that had given its export ##ers advantages in the world market . the soviet he ##ge ##mony in eastern europe provided the foundation for a separate international economic system . but the soviets never threatened the us economic he ##ge ##mony . after the war , united states experienced rapid industrial growth and capital accumulation . federal taxes on incomes , profits and payroll ##s which had risen to high levels during world war ii were cut back slowly . the middle class swelled . so did the gdp and productivity . this growth was distributed fairly evenly across the economic classes . some attribute this to the strength of the labor unions whose membership peaked during the 1950s . much of the growth came from the movement of low income farm workers into better paying jobs in the towns and cities . this process was largely completed by 1960 . congress created the council of economic advisors ( ce ##a ) to promote high employment , high profits and low inflation . the eisenhower administration ( 1953 – 1961 ) supported an active economic approach that helped	it ' s possible you may find an newer edition of this book there . alternatively , if you don ' t find an another version , the < a hr ##ef = " https : / / www . smashwords . com / profile / view / lucian " > publisher profile page < / a > may provides links to the publisher ' s web site and social media .	1

the strong back ##light ##ing . it ’ s easy to “ over ##do ” the intensity of sunset hue ##s on paper . i try to keep colors luminous , transparent and subtle to achieve realism when painting the sky . the sky is the source of the light , thus the artist must determine the position of the sun and work on values consistently , despite their quick changes happening during the outdoor painting . in this picture that i took in rome , the sky light is warm in its color temperature . the same tin ##ts of warm yellow would be used to draw the sunset clouds . this yellowish line in the sky contrasts with cooler , gray ##er and darker hue ##s of the upper clouds and the cool silhouette of buildings and trees in the italian landscape . the drama of the half - hidden sun peeking through the cloud after rain looks very attractive to paint . the top and bottom con ##tour of the cloud is well defined and its outline should be represented faithful ##ly on paper . the top outline itself is yellowish but should be drawn around with maximum precision in a relatively dark color combination of gray ##s , yellow ##s and browns . at the same time it ’ s important not to create unnatural ##ly intense contrast with the sharp edge of the cloud . this sky is all about capturing the color and visual distinction between cool blue and warm orange . the cloud edges should stay soft , and feather ##ing strokes are the best bet for drawing this picture . i would work from light to dark here because it ’ s vital to establish soft transitions between values and colors . the center of the sky would have more yellow in it while the lower part would have more red . these blue sunset clouds are perfect illustration of the linear and aerial perspective in a sky . though varied in size , they are all about the same color value and are even similar in their form , appearing almost symmetrical . they look smaller , flat ##ter and closer together in the distance , with less distinct color gr ##ada ##tions and intensity . to capture this illusion , draw larger clouds in the upper sky and gradually reducing the size of the clouds close to the horizon line . also , those closest to the viewer should display more clearly - defined edges . these are low cum ##ulus clouds most often seen during on a bright afternoon . you need to record the outline of the picture ’ s dominant clouds with reference to their respective size . the tops of the clouds reflect lots of light ( highlights ) , while	i went behind a juniper bush and tried the same thing . i imagined being human , pic ##turing every part of my body , until i felt a tingling along my limbs .	1

replacing it with its definition would show why . finite ##ness , then , becomes one the the keys , of the default conditions that make for existence having to be a forced state , which i will try to get more into elsewhere . william lane craig , a cleric famous for trying to introduce god out of nowhere , perhaps due to a bias of wishing for such , did get as far as to note that all things must have beginnings . unfortunately , as an aside , this would include beings and beings ( namely , god ) . he also noted that there is no source for things , which is true for sure , although many might just slip right on past this important point . but then he stumbled , driven by so much wanting ‘ god ’ , claiming that ‘ god did it ’ , begging the question beyond repair . i leave the rest as an exercise for now .	ways , by self - contradiction , cutting him out at the source , making anything else mo ##ot , such as more attributes layered on by imagination , and , further , we can de ##du ##ce how and why existence came about , which doesn ' t have ‘ god ’ in it . eternal duration is another matter , but just slightly , for as referenced earlier , it may have ‘ persistence ’ before it changes form , its potential for change une ##x ##er ##cise ##d for a time . and , indeed , all is a continuum of the big event of the ‘ bang ’ and before . no , it implies that t ( it is raining ) = 0 and t ( it is not raining ) = 0 . that is , neither are true . perhaps there is a kind of fog about , making the situation ind ##eter ##minate . as for “ unmarried man ” , that could be taken as ‘ currently unmarried ’ , which it probably often is , as ‘ not married ’ , although the ‘ un ’ could mean that the man never was married . “ bachelor ” is for a man who is not married and never was and doesn ’ t intend to be , as a way of life . nor is he in a pair - bond . if he is adamant , then he is a confirmed bachelor , and not an eligible bachelor . the pope is a bachelor , technically , and for good reason . nuns extend the word ‘ marriage ’ by being married to god . there is also common - law ‘ marriage ’ . at one time , i nearly fell for the objects of short ##cut words as being actual , when people used the , words such as ‘ infinite ’ , ‘ forever ’ , and ‘ by faith ’ ( as reason or	0

. the darkness blanket ##ed me , covering my eyes so i couldn ' t see myself . i felt things , but i didn ' t know if they were really there . i heard things , but i didn ' t see the source of the sounds . the only thing that was real to me were my thoughts and they weren ' t tangible . i questioned my existence . it was surreal that i was what i was . there was nothing on this earth like us , so what if we weren ' t real ? what if the life i was living was some kind of fabricated lifetime ? how would i wake myself up ? i knew the answer to that was obvious . it ' s something i think about all the time . i wonder if any of the others thought about suicide , or if the long run had ever entered their minds . mother had told us the horrors of the world . that ' s why she kept us on lock ##down . it would make me question what kind of future i would have . a lifetime of living in that house would drive me insane , a lifetime of living outside of it wouldn ' t last very long . i look like a mutant , i would be killed like one . the only solution i had to accept was that there was no future for me . i wanted to kill myself so many times . i wanted to get one of those kitchen knives and jam it into my neck . i just never had the guts to do it . death is final , uncertain , i wasn ' t ready to face it so abruptly . so instead , i continued to suffer without a friend to talk to . and then , mother died . i had spent my years worried about being trapped in our home forever . it was now time to face the other fear , living out in the ruthless world she described . when we left our house , i started thinking . our plan was to be on the run , to hide until we could find a place to be free . but i realized that it ' s as bad living underground as it is living in captivity . we ' ll never get to live full lives , despite what tia ##go or oscar might think . the only life we could have is that of a rat , a ve ##rmin living off the scrap ##s of others , doing whatever dec ##re ##pit thing it takes to survive . i was a bigger target than ever . no doubt when someone sees me , they ' ll	the others looked unique , almost beautiful , i do not . no life to live indeed . my worries came collapsing down and i had nowhere left to go .	0

my membership renewal came due i had to give serious pause to my involvement . i had developed a deep connection to the organization and had made many good friends . it was really tearing me apart that i had to leave the organization so i could invest my marketing money and time where i found the return to be more favorable . at its core , the organization is about supporting and growing businesses in the region . i certainly had contributed to some of the businesses with my purchases and helped bring new members and volunteers into the group . perhaps i could just renew my membership and become one of the many passive members . unfortunately , that is not my style . when i looked at the return on investment for my time and money , the marketing effort just did not make sense . you have to move your limited marketing resources into the ‘ highest and best use ’ category to realize a return . since i track where my leads come from and the cost of those leads from the specific marketing effort , how could i have gone so long dumping time and money into a marketing dead - end ? my only explanation is that i was blinded by faith and passion for the organization . i insisted that eventually my efforts would pay off . when you are struggling for survival in your small business , you can ’ t become emotionally attached to a particular marketing program or path . that was my failure	i don ’ t regret my involvement in the organization . there are no sour grapes and i would never di ##spar ##age the group or its mission . you , just like i did , have to face reality that just because you love something , it does not necessarily make good business sense . family diversity caution : bright spot ahead . i was fortunate to work with a same sex couple raising a child . i can ’ t tell you how much i want to ‘ violently ’ advocate on their behalf when religious leaders and politicians talk der ##isi ##vel ##y about same sex marriage . i have a wonderful son that would be just as unique and brilliant raised by mom and dad as by two mom ##s or dad ##s . marketing people talk about staying away from the controversial , but i tend to embrace it . this post is just another attempt to define myself and what i believe in , if not secretly want , to anyone who will listen . i am not sure i can get much more open about my feelings than this . i even created a lgbt insurance page on my website . all of this was an attempt to remain relevant and to keep dream alive that i can connect and make a difference . posted on november 5 , 2011 two dad ##s and a son .	0

that the appropriate standard of review remains reasonable ##ness , [ 76 ] as previously articulated by the supreme court of canada in matt ##el u . s . a . inc . v . 38 ##9 ##42 ##0 ##7 canada inc . [ 77 ] 5 . appeals from decisions of the federal court decisions from the federal court are appeal ##able to the federal court of appeal [ 78 ] and are governed by part 6 of the federal courts rules . 6 . costs although costs from a section 45 proceeding before the trade - marks opposition board are not available to the parties because the registrar has no authority to grant an award of costs under the act , on appeals of decisions of the registrar before the federal court , costs are available as provided for by part 11 of the federal courts rules . however , although a party may recover its costs before the federal court , parties are typically not able to recover costs before both the federal court and the registrar .

thin ##a prevailed upon them to give me some time to ref ##resh myself , and we went to her apartment . in fact , we walked , since it was really very close , so close that we got there before my luggage , which someone was bringing in a car , because it had to det ##our through one - way streets . again i was struck by the contrast between the outside and inside of the buildings . outside , the courtyard , entrance , staircase are rather derelict - looking , with chunks of cement missing here and there , ru ##ts and pot ##holes in the ground , occasional steps cave ##d in . inside , thin ##a ' s apartment was bright and cheerful , with good solid furniture , everything in excellent taste and good condition . although some compare this state of affairs with what exists in certain projects here in the us , where the public parts are really awful , with garbage , rats , and smells of urine all over , in contrast with some of the apartments which are fairly well kept inside , the comparison would be misleading .	, the one they fished out of the water at tenant ' s harbor . i looked at it this morning . that could be rough on anyone .

the very last time i saw him was inside courtroom # 7 in the van courthouse on horn ##by street , where he was convicted of one count of first - degree murder plus several counts of fraud . my last image is of him wearing a prisoner ’ s jumps ##uit , handcuffs and leg iron ##s , and being led out of the courtroom by two bu ##rly sheriff ##s . he still had that arrogant smirk on his face that he often wore , yet i knew it was a useless pose , as he would be spending decades locked up away from society . the feeling it gave me was most satisfying , and the fact i had been largely responsible was even more satisfying . if this is what it felt like to be a private investigator , i knew i had definitely made the right career choice . afterwards , i threw a ce ##le ##bra ##tory lunch ##eon for daniel , petra , the whole surveillance team , the swat men ( and , as it turned out , one woman ) and legal team at , ironically , alejandro ’ s where i had once sp ##ied upon jacques during one of his robot - investor meetings . ted paid for the whole shin ##di ##g , as he ’ d included a clause in his will that when ( not if , because he had so much confidence in my abilities ) i had cracked the case and brought the per ##pet ##rator ( s ) to justice , i was to throw a celebration for all of the people who ’ d worked so hard on the case . ted was still a generous man , even post ##mo ##rte ##m . and later that night , in my apartment , daniel and i threw our own private celebration , which i shall just keep to myself because it is , well , private . * * * * cod ##a no . 2 this whole period of my life turned out to be one of the most satisfying . not only did i help bring ted ’ s killer to justice , and clean the streets of yet another das ##tar ##dly criminal , i managed to earn the respect and admiration of the only man who has ever made my knees turn to jelly merely at the sound of his voice . daniel and i have been together now for six months . i even like his kids from his previous marriage , ages 4 and 6 ; two boys named bryce and clancy , and they seem to like me despite the fact i don ’ t usually give off mother ##ly type vibe ##s .	i guess you could say they don ’ t mind me and i don ’ t mind them . for now i have no plans to move in with daniel , nor for him to move in with me .	0

the soul may know everything , it is never at rest until it comes to the original idea , in which all things are one . and there it comes to rest in god . ( q ##t ##d . in old 44 ##9 ) ec ##khar ##t describes a mystical relationship between the angels , the human soul , and ultimately to god himself . in mystical christianity , angels are sent to the soul of an individual so that the individual may become en ##light ##ened by the knowledge of the one true god . like spin ##oza , ec ##khar ##t ’ s ideas caused him to run af ##ou ##l of the church fathers of his day . in their essay entitled , “ a theology called mystical , ” jean ge ##rson and william james explain , “ certain of ec ##khar ##t ’ s teachings were declared by pope john xx ##ii to be tainted by the ‘ stain of heresy ’ or at least ‘ evil - sounding and very rash and suspect of heresy ’ ” ( 7 ) . in spite of the condemnation by the pope , the writings of mei ##ster ec ##khar ##t became widespread and widely studied by other mystical ##ly minded theologians ( 7 ) . angels as they are understood in the islamic tradition are discussed by scholar and founder of the na ##q ##sh ##band ##i - ha ##q ##qa ##ni sufi order of america , shay ##kh mu ##ham ##med his ##ham ka ##bba ##ni . he writes : “ the existence of angels [ as messengers of god ] is one of the pillars of belief in most religious traditions and that is the case in islam also ” ( 15 ) . he presents a poetic description of angels as expressed in islamic religious lore : god has created a tree in the seventh heaven , on each leaf of which is found one letter of the ko ##ran . every leaf is a throne carved from a precious stone , and every letter is represented by an angel sitting on that throne . each angel is the key to	the diver into these oceans is the archangel gabriel . ( 16 ) islamic belief in the seventh heaven as a place of perfection emerges from an ancient piece of persian folklore entitled “ muhammad ’ s journey to heaven . ” authored by eighth century biographer ibn - is ##ha ##q , the story is told that muhammad was sleeping one night when the angel gabriel awakened him and together they climbed a divine ladder through the levels of heaven . in the first level he met adam and in the second he met jesus and john the baptist . as he ascended he met joseph , enoch , aaron , and moses and in the seventh heaven , the highest sphere of the heavens , he met abraham sitting on ##the throne at the entrance to paradise .	0

most of them had exercise prices between $ 8 . 00 and $ 10 . 00 . the shares were trading at $ 11 . 00 , so there wasn ’ t a lot of money to be made right now . there was a time about three years ago when the shares had reached $ 16 . 00 on speculation that we were being taken over but because of insider trading rules none of the executives could ' cash ' in . harold did ##rick ##son had informed everyone that there were ' windows ' , or time periods , when it was legal to exercise their options . at the time the shares sky ##rock ##ete ##d to $ 16 . 00 , our audit ##ed quarterly financial statements were in the process of being finalized . our executives knew about the financial results and the public didn ’ t , so that was considered a closed ' window ' because they were in possession of inside information , and therefore , it was illegal to trade in the company ' s shares .	chance to become members . they then , in turn , stood to weave a tale of their own . afterwards , carol relay ##ed to them that when they could weave a tale such as the one that peter or herself had just woven , they could return and try again . carol had also decided to assign them an idea for their second attempt . after some thought , carol instructed the hopeful weaver ##s the task of making up tales of far - off realms , wizards , and goblin ##s as their test . “ you may take up to three days to return , with your tale ready to present or be disqualified forever ! ” three days later , carol and peter were both surprised when two of them did not come back at all . by the time the third came back , they had almost given up on him too . “ i wanted to be sure i had an account worthy of weaving for you , so i can become the newest member , ” he explained , as he took up his place by the tire swing . in order to look as ominous and powerful as they could , carol and peter sat down on the old chairs they had set up , to use as their throne ##s and prepared to listen once more . peter leaned over and whispered to carol , “ i hope this tale that he has prepared for us is better than the last one . ” the boy began weaving his tale as if he were one of their faithful subjects , who had come to entertain them , as he spoke of past battles that he had won for the lands . at the end of his narrative , he informed carol and peter that he had to move next week , but he	1

by jar ##a , are administered by da ##ku - , as he brings one cyclic process to a close , and allows for a smooth transition into another . many people are aware of the concept of the “ river of life , ” which em ##bo ##dies the souls of eternal existence . da ##ku , however , em ##bo ##dies a more trans ##cend ##ental concept called the “ river of time . ” this river em ##bo ##dies the eternal existence experienced by vital souls . an explanation follows : all life can be viewed as a drop ##let of water rushing with the current . time seems to pass by , but the current remains the same . the drop ##let remains in the moment of being , or the ever - present here and now . as this present moment continually passes away , awareness of being is always new . . therefore , all life occurs in a moment of time . as the water drop ##let is perceived in the moment of being , the moment of being itself , is perceived at the point between light and dark . this is where all space and time meet in the here and now . - eh ##sti ’ s objective as the primary rune in the sphere of the unified whole , is to establish all of creation as one unified whole , and to provide a basis for the inter ##dim ##ens ##ional links which maintain the unified whole . as the 5th run ##ic light which is white , eh ##sti performs this duty , establishing the one ##ness of all creation , known otherwise , as the odin ##ic principle . to understand odin in a trans ##cend ##ental sense , we must come to terms with three perceptions : a . the perception of reality beyond the cycles of time and manifestation . b . a perception of the passage of events as ever - evolving construct ##s of life - energy . c . a perception of sound in terms of transition through per ##ce ##pt ##ual awareness , and as the vehicle of conscious experience of varying spa ##cial phenomena which , in reality , all share the same space and time	before examining these three aspects in greater detail , allow me first , to clarify my use of the phrase , per ##ce ##pt ##ual awareness . this is not a red ##unda ##ncy , but rather a means by which the seemingly in ##ex ##pl ##ica ##ble may be explained . as we know , to be aware of something is to have knowledge or co ##gni ##zan ##ce - to be mind ##ful of it . to perceive , we know , is to become aware through the senses . however , my use of the term involves a psychic , or even spiritual sense , rather than one of the five standard senses through which we normally gain perception .	0

me language . so in interacting in a new culture , i needed another language , to enter into it - into that dimension . so god gives you a gift , because you are about to be immersed into another culture , into another realm - the realm of the spirit , and you need greater expression . it ' s hard to just keep telling jesus you love him : i love you , i love you - you run out of words ; so god gives you a language that never runs out of expression . so the gift of tongues is the holy spirit . they spoke , as the spirit gave them the utter ##ance ; so your holy spirit imp ##arts into your spirit the language , and then you let go and surrender , and allow that flow to come out . you are speaking in that language , so notice what it says in verse 14 – “ when you speak in tongues , your spirit is praying ” - so your spirit has a voice . remember we talked about the different aspects of your spirit ? your spirit has a voice . your spirit has a mind . your spirit can speak . when you ' re speaking in tongues , you ' re not working it out with your head ; you are letting your spirit yield to the holy spirit , and speaking out a language - it ' s a real language . notice what happens - there ' s a whole number of benefits with that real language . verse 4 – “ when you speak in an unknown tongue , you are building up yourself , like a house being constructed ” . so praying in tongues strengthen ##s and builds and develops your spirit man . when you pray in tongues , you are co - operating with the holy ghost directly , and your whole spirit man starts to en ##er ##gis ##e with life . it ' s a wonderful gift , wonderful	you can pray anytime in the spirit , because the flow of the language just never stops . the holy spirit is the spirit of prayer . he ' s always willing to pray through you ; so you can pray in tongues anywhere , everywhere , any time of day or night , wherever you ' re going . keep your eyes open if you ' re driving - but you can pray in tongues ! when you ' re doing this , you are ‘ building up yourself ’ , is one thing it tells us . it tells us another thing : you are ‘ en ##er ##gis ##ing your inner life with the holy ghost ’ . so when you pray in tongues strongly for a while , you ' ll feel your whole body start to en ##er ##gis ##e up , because you ’ re expressing the life of your spirit .	0

the tracks would be the death ##bl ##ow for any would - be jumper . at sixty miles an hour , the large rocks would work like extra - large grit sand ##paper . they would tear me apart . i knew immediately that given the options , freezing to death would be a much better method of dying than jumping . suddenly , freezing to death seemed like a very reasonable expectation . well , ve ##d , here you are … as far as my bags went , there were some factors to consider there too . what if the doors were open on the other side of the box ##car , and instead of throwing my bag into the car , i ’ d thrown it in one side and out the other ? i hadn ’ t even checked to see if the other side was closed or wide open . i threw it hard , plenty hard enough for it to have slid right across the floor and out the other door , meaning it could potentially be right where the old man had been parked waiting when the first train passed . this idea terrified me . everything i needed to survive was in that bag . everything that i had in this world , including my wallet , my pot , and my pills were in that fucking bag , and it terrified me to think that it all could be sitting right there where i ’ d started from . or , what if it had made it into the train car , but the car wasn ’ t empty ? what if , like me , some asshole was st ##owing away in there already ? he would certainly go through the bag , discovering the weed , the gun , the wallet … everything . not only would he have all my shit , he ’ d have my gun , and if i could ever get to that car , what ’ s to keep him from shooting me in	i ’ d really fucked this up . i sat on the platform with my back against another ladder that went up and over the tanker , watching the train expand as it gained momentum . i ’ d never realized that before . a train moving at sixty miles an hour in the open country is longer than one slowing down . the arms , or connection points between cars , flex and expand probably two or three feet as the train pulls away . the platform on the identical car across the gap from me was now six feet from my own , whereas when we were in town , it ’ d only been maybe three . i thought it was fascinating , or maybe i just thought that thinking about the expansion was more appealing than thinking about dying , which was a thought that kept making its way back into my mind .	0

the book was a fast read and i skimmed through about three chapters before i stopped to light a cigarette . the story was similar to the dozens of other novels i had read - poor woman , rich man . they meet , they argue , they secretly pine for each other and eventually end up locking lips in a mad embrace at the end of a particularly nasty argument . i thought about why i read these books . always looking for my knight in shining armour and reading these books kind of kept the fantasy alive . reading for me was pure es ##cap ##ism and i justified my habit by reminding myself i didn ’ t drink or take drugs . cigarettes and romance books . my two vice ##s . probably time to clean up my act . i heaved myself off the couch and stood looking out the front windows to the street below . i was restless and had na ##gging feelings which i tried to pin ##point . i had frantically cleaned my apartment and ate my dinner like a steve ##dor ##e . my planned and forced relaxation on the couch hadn ’ t lasted long . as usual , i was avoiding things . evelyn ’ s death hung over me . as tri ##te as it sounded , it made me sad . sad is an emotion that usually doesn ’ t have any backbone and it ’ s hard to define . my whole body started to ache with sadness , thinking about her . the more i thought about ev , the more restless i became . i paced in the living room and ruined the nice look of the freshly vacuum ##ed carpet . i couldn ’ t understand her death . why did she have to die ? i had been avoiding thinking about her all day by keeping busy and now i didn ’ t have anything to keep me occupied . the book bored me . i checked the tv guide to see if there were any sports on the television and as usual , i came up empty . friday night sitcom ##s and news shows . forget it . i phone ##d danny . i hadn ’ t talked to him since last night . the phone rang a couple of times before he answered .

a dry leaf driven by the wind this way and that , old mary has returned . it is almost biblical . she is dry , safe on dry ground in her island home . only her coat , dripping in the closet , tells of the long journey and the rain . is she un ##sp ##ons ##ored in the hollow of her old bed , her frail form lodged there in the depths , in the exhaustion of her long journey ? or does memory , the warm fabric of memory itself — held beyond conscious awareness — surround her now as she rests in the darkened sanctuary of all that her mother maintained ; of all that her father wanted to extend and ultimately left ? fin ##is in the darkness mary wake ##ns . in the darkness almost wool ##en , gathered around her like a blanket , she can hear his voice . she cannot see the faded curtains or the dark frame of the window , but she can hear the voice . at first she thought it was her confirmation pastor from long ago , but now she knows better . she can hear it quite plainly now . her father is talking to her in the darkness . it seems to mary that he is in another room , a room to the east . and he is calling . sometimes she thinks she is with him in church , sitting on his lap as the final hymn is being sung . the communion is over and the old hymn is wa ##fting on the air : i came to jesus as i was weary , and worn , and sad i found in him a resting place , and he has made me glad . her father ’ s voice is there . yes . she can hear his voice , thin ##ning on the highest notes as it always did until it almost disappears in the larger chorus of voices lifted softly . but then she wonders if it is voices that she is hearing , or	whatever it is , it has come for her . it is drawing her forth — inviting her out . mary can hear her heart thumping , pounding away beneath the thin crust of her fragile chest . she thinks of the wind : it is like the wind , come again . it pushes her away . the wind is a hand in the middle of her back , shoving her . she thinks of her umbrella , her cane . the wind is probing , un ##pin ##ning all the protections . the wind is in her heart . go on out ! she can feel the wind , forcing her to other places . she has known it in many ways in all her years , felt it on her body , heard it at the windows and in the protest of the very timbers of the house .	0
“ what do you want , orion ? ” king frederic said with an air of a man who had been bothered with nonsense too many times . orion said nothing . “ i haven ’ t got all day , you know , ” he paused , but orion didn ’ t say anything . “ look , orion , ” he sighed angrily , gesturing to the pile of papers and folder ##s , “ i ’ ve got a lot of work to do . say what you ’ ve got to say or get out . i don ’ t have time for your foolish ##ness . ” still , orion kept his silence . frederic ’ s voice was rising . “ what is it , already ? ! ” orion didn ’ t say a word . king frederic was about to throw orion out of the room when he noticed the look of utter terror on his son ’ s face . king frederic followed orion ’ s gaze to the tiny flicker of a candle flame on the desk . “ oh , for goodness ’ sake ! ” king frederic scowled at orion , “ just ignore it , orion ! what do you want ? ” orion took a step backwards .	to risk the conditions on the planet surface ? her crew agreed with the choice , she wasn ’ t entirely to blame , and yet the guilt still ripped at her . so she buried her crew , gave them each a proper funeral , or as proper as one can give in the forever wet conditions . but it still didn ’ t feel like enough . somehow she had to make contact with someone , tell them of the brave actions of her crew . find some meaning . hugging a flight jacket , her only piece of civilian clothing , she pondered on her next course of action . she finished the last of the ratio ##n packs 4 days ago and had barely enough water for a few more days . the rain was too toxic to drink . _ i can stay and die with my crew , but no one will bury me with them . or i can walk , go find something , or at least die trying . i could try . _ lace decided to go east because she saw the tips of the egyptian pyramid ##s as they flew by in a west ##erly direction during their disastrous descent . the thing that struck her the most was the glare . it was like they were made of crystal . she also noticed that the ground was sc ##or ##ched and glossy . the gas cloud turned the sand to glass . she took one last look at the so ##ggy mounds of her crew ’ s shallow graves and said a silent prayer : _ you ’ ll be remembered ; i ’ ll	1

lifted as they ve ##ered north to skirt the edge of the property . after a walk that seemed like a second compared to the hike from the incident at the house ; they came up behind the cemetery that they had to cut through to get to the streets they called home . “ trent you have to get home , so you can get to a doctor ! ” janet winced at the sight of the blood soaked in the shirt that he still held on his face . “ ye ##a trent go . ” mage ##nta snapped : “ we ’ ll go home from here . ” “ ye ##a me too . you got it , right trent ? ” nathan shot gruff ##ly . trent nodded . “ i ’ ll be with him . ” jason said . “ ye ##a , c ’ mon jason . you guys don ’ t tell your parents about that old lady okay ? ” they all shrugged their shoulders and nodded sheep ##ishly . nathan was the first one to speak : “ nothing about the old lady . ” “ let ’ s go . ” mage ##nta grabbed janet ’ s hand . the girls looked sadly to trent as they walked away . “ see ya nathan . ” trent smiled . “ ye ##a take care . ” nathan took off towards his house alone . jason and trent went in a different direction around the edge of the graveyard towards the street they shared as neighbors . the two came around the corner where trent ’ s house came into view . trent gasped with relief when he saw that his dad ’ s car wasn ’ t there . “ cool , my dad ’ s not here , c ’ mon ! ” he sped up his pace . “ trent , you need your dad ’ s help . you need a doctor ! ” jason argued . “ my dad ’ ll kill me . c ’ mon we ’ ll find my mom . she can tell him . ” the two rushed inside . trent went straight to the kitchen . “ mom ! ” he called . there was no answer . he found a note on the refrigerator that read : trent , we went out for dinner , we ’ ll be at the toad for the rest of the night , make yourself dinner , xx ##oo mom . “ they ’ re out for the night . ” trent seemed relieved . “ what are we gonna ’ do ? ” jason asked : “ what about your face ? ” “ i ’ ll tell my mom in the morning . “ you need a doctor now ! ” jason was becoming exasperated . “ they can stitch it up	i ’ ll clean it and put a bandage on it ’ ll be fine .	0
recounts – often in amusing detail - some of his adventures . he became possibly the first western ##er to complete a famous pilgrimage to thirty - three temples in northern japan . on another pilgrimage he spent three days hiking through some of japan ’ s ho ##liest mountains , sometimes standing under fr ##ig ##id waterfalls in purification rituals . he stayed at famous monasteries , often participating in morning worship services full of dazzling ceremonies . he introduces some of the fascinating people he met . these include the young priest who lived and med ##itated in a giant soy sauce barrel ; the professor who devised “ com ##mut ##ing zen ” meditation for his strap - hanging one - and - a - half - hour rail com ##mute to work each day ; and the american advertising executive who became head of his own japanese zen temple , a place where caroline kennedy , now us ambassador to japan , stayed during her honeymoon . but he also explains why his interest in buddhism began to fade , and why , today , he is a christian . this short book , part travel adventure , part memoir , part spiritual odyssey , will entertain and inform . devotion ##al studies * a psalm for the battle : reflections on psalm 18 , christians and warfare what does god really think about war ? this short devotion ##al uses the res ##ound ##ing words of psalm 18 - in which david praises god for victory in battle - to examine some of the ethical issues of christianity and warfare . questions are asked , such as when can a christian soldier kill ? how are we to understand some of the blood ##thi ##rst ##y passages of the old testament ? does god still provide guidance to military commanders , as he did in old testament times ? what does a christian do when ordered on a suicide mission ? some of the answers are surprising , including test ##imo ##nies from modern - day military leaders who have clearly heard god speaking to them at critical times of battle . and did you know that some of the japanese kam ##ika ##ze pilots - who deliberately crashed their aircraft into american warships during world war ii - were devout christians ? how did they reconcile their actions with their faith ? but ultimately this devotion ##al is about the spiritual battle faced by every christian . * love , justice and power : the message of pass ##over for christians pass ##over is a jewish celebration of the mighty acts of god in li ##ber ##ating the ancient israeli ##tes from slavery in egypt . but it is also much more . for the events that culminated in pass ##over tell us a moment ##ous story about god ' s power , his love for his people and his justice . yet there is even more .	not bad at all .	1

she yawned , then stretched while he walked off towards the small graveyard . she was a bit surprised ; he wasn ’ t usually shy about pee ##ing in front of her . the limbs above her creaked in a gust of wind , sp ##lat ##tering her with loosened snow . by the time she brushed herself off , zach had halted by a tombstone . she watched as he cleared the top of the rectangular slab . watched as he traced his glove ##d fingers along what must be a carved ep ##ita ##ph . watched as he pulled off her elastic , tipped back his head , and held his arms out cr ##uc ##iform , an angular scare ##crow in a sc ##rim of ski ##rling snow . the heads ##tones like gods ##we ##pt wind ##row ##s the cold and dead of a winter dusk .	the look of the sky , it ’ s already raining this side of the oasis . ” trembling from head to feet , naomi rolled her eyes . she squinted in the bright sunshine . “ there ’ s not a cloud in the sky out my window , ” she stated . trent tapped her shoulder . she jumped , w ##hir ##ling around to face him . “ see the band of grey clouds directly ahead , near the horizon ? ” his voice sounded friendly , yet full of authority . naomi squinted against the bright sun streaming through the window . she hid her skepticism . “ if you scan the horizon to my left you ’ ll see a solid mass of midnight black clouds , ” reported trent . “ i saw them a while ago . the clouds don ’ t seem much of a threat seeing how they aren ’ t directly in front of the plane . ” the plane changed direction seven degrees to the left and started to descend . naomi ’ s eyes widened , staring at the black mass approaching , now directly in front . “ tell me you ’ re only trying to scare me ? ” “ i ’ m not that cruel . they ’ re bad storm clouds , ” advised trent . naomi choked on her words . “ why did you change direction ? ” “ the oasis is to our left , exactly where the clouds are the darkest . ” “ will there be lightning ? ” trent nodded as he made the plane dive towards the ground . “ we ’ re almost there . the wind is picking up . in three minutes , we ’ ll be standing on the ground . ” naomi managed to flash a win ##try day smile , watching the clouds lo ##om closer . the black swirling mass appeared to be moving incredibly fast . the clouds resembled giant charcoal colored cotton balls which were dipped in black ink and hung low in the sky	1

there are red dogs , white dogs , brown dogs , spotted dogs and all sorts of other color mixes . there are dogs with flat faces , dogs with pointed noses and dogs with long wiener - shaped bodies . there are bald dogs with smooth skin , skinny dogs with curly white hair , and big hairy dogs with muscular , large bodies . why so many different dog types ? what function produced all these different mutations ? prevailing thought is that all of these various dog breeds evolved from one ‘ master ’ dog species : the wolf . in order to accomplish this , however , a curious accidental evolutionary process has been proposed to explain all these mutations . this means that all these mutations must have taken place only within the last 10 , 000 - 14 , 000 years . while this theory has been controversial , and dna research has been con ##fo ##und ##ing , recent studies using the dna from mit ##och ##ond ##ria rather than dna from the cell nucleus has indicated that the theory that all these dog species evolved from the wolf — more specifically , the grey wolf - - is plausible . the problem , however , is that the mit ##och ##ond ##ria research also indicates that the evolution of wolves to dogs began over 100 , 000 years ago .	of these controversies , the theory says that the wolf was gradually bred by humans into more and more domestic ##ated versions . this also means all the different and crazy mutations such as terri ##ers , da ##chs ##hun ##ds , boxers and chihuahua ##s . how and why did these nut ##ty - looking dogs develop their characteristics ? what evolutionary benefit did it give them ? and why would these dogs mu ##tate so quickly , while the development of other species generally has taken millions of years to take place . certainly , the features didn ’ t help them survive longer or better . in fact , in many cases these “ pure breed ” dogs actually die sooner than normal dogs , with ai ##lm ##ents caused by mal ##fu ##nction ##ing organs inherent among that breed . in the 1950s , a fox domestic ##ation breeding experiment that continues to this day was directed by dr . dmitry bel ##ya ##ev of the then - soviet union ’ s institute of cy ##tology and genetics in novo ##si ##bir ##sk , siberia . the intent of this long - term study was to determine the genetic role humans played in the domestic ##ation of animals . most importantly , he wanted to study how contact with humans might bring about not only new behavior but also changes in body features and physiology . the prime subjects of the study were silver foxes , who were cruel ##ly cage ##d while they and their offspring were put into various degrees of contact with humans .	0
i stood there looking at his disgusting face , letting my anger build . i could feel it starting at the tips of my toes and spreading up my body . i threw my hand up facing my palm toward him .	up loud showed some cartoons that normally only young children would have wanted to see . nobody was in the room . and anyone who was in the room wasn ' t watching the tv or even capable of it . the patients looked generally better off who lived in the self - contained rehab units . indeed , they were better off as only the more well patients went to rehab . the criteria were that they were socially competent , physically fit and not just free of symptoms of mental illness . these apartments had a discharge rate of at least one or two every six months . so , as i was a better patient who should be able to get a place in one , i might be able to leave in a reasonable time as these things go . meanwhile , the hospital offered me some ot doing art and cooking . we did art as a therapy . today , they said that we would have an ' art therapist ' taking the art group . when i approached him , however , he told me he was not an art therapist . as well , he said to call him by his first name . or ' just call me the artist ' . this was who he was . but if he found it flat ##tering , i don ' t know . he had told me he had no training in art therapy , but i could come along and draw a picture . before the session , he spent some time finding the patients and per ##su ##ading them to come . the session started and he gave us pieces of paper and put out some paints . we began to draw and paint . after i finished my picture , i reached for more paper . but when i did this , he asked me what i was doing . he said that one picture was enough for one day and i should finish off my day ' s art by commenting on my picture to the group . then he said that he would see what i did the next week and went around the other residents to ask them about their pictures . i also cooked with one of the nursing assistants . this was the meal for all the patients on the ward and we started preparing it about an hour before everyone came to eat . we chopped or peeled vegetables and opened cans . the meals were not that lavish , but the work made me feel better about myself . i helped prepare this evening meal once a week and i found it was all right really if it kept	1

" sir , you aren ' t seriously thinking of going alone are you ? " " unless you can think of an alternative , it would appear i have no choice . " the room stayed silent with everyone ' s gaze locked on me . " thought so . " i pulled my way through the doors and floated to the cargo bay where we kept our only shuttle . unfortunately , basic flight training was not my strong suit . i would have to manage since i didn ' t have much of a choice . it took a call into far ##ley and a well placed fist to a control panel but i managed to get the shuttle out of the docking bay .	promised he would fix it as soon as i got back . maneuver ##ing over and around the alien ship , i took in the scope of changes the vessel holding us had taken . now that i knew what to look for i could see bits and pieces taken from dozens , if not hundreds of other ships . the alien craft looked built out of almost every kind of known ship , and a few unknown types thrown in for good measure . using the thrust ##ers , i maneuver ##ed the shuttle to the back of the alien ship . i saw the bay doors were already open for me . inside was an exact copy of the shuttle i was flying except for modifications similar to what the ship had . the call numbers on its side were also a direct match of my own ship . i un ##buck ##led myself and was surprised to find the gravity inside this ship was working . this ship might have once been the same as mine but it sure isn ' t now . i wonder how these aliens got over the containment problem of a micro black hole , or did they find another way to create their own gravity all together . i forced myself to snap back to reality . here i was in the belly of an alien ship that was holding my own cruiser hostage . this was no time to examine the science of the alien vessel . removing my blast ##er from the holster at my hip , i looked around the bay for any signs of life . the entire place seemed deserted . the door that would lead up towards the bridge on my ship was wide open as if to say , go this way . i didn ' t seem to have much of a choice . the long climb was much harder than simply floating as i had in my ship . it did little for improving my mood , and i found myself jumping at every corner . whoever is in charge of this tub had better have a damn good reason for all this , or i might just shoot first and ask questions	0

i setup a conference call to get everyone together but the users did not show up . in the meantime alfonso keeps sending flaming emails to fred . so i walked over to his cube and asked him to contribute to the solution by getting someone to show up on this conference call . he told me that this is not his problem and shortly after i left his cube he fired off another email to fred . alfonso is so focused on power that he thinks he can increase his power with fred by amp ##li ##fying the problem we are now having . when it comes down to it , he is not interested in solving the problem . he is not looking out for anyone other than himself . eventually i got some users onto the call and we confirmed that the problem they are experiencing has nothing to do with our changes . now that we know what the problem is our technical people are working on it . and from that crisis we transitioned directly over to another crisis . i setup a conference call today to try to get resolution on the problem that fred described in his email this morning .	“ what happened ? you have to tell me . ” “ i shouldn ’ t have done it . ” “ done what ? ” “ it . with jared . ” “ oh … did he hurt you or something ? ” i asked , afraid of the answer . “ it was my first time , ” she mumbled and at first , i thought i ’ d heard her wrong . “ what did you say ? ” “ it was my first time . i was a virgin , okay . ” i tried to rein in my surprise . instead of asking why she had pretended to sleep with guys before , i asked the more immediate question . “ then why did you ? ” “ he didn ’ t ask me if i was sure . guys always ask if you ’ re sure you want to … it ’ s always my way out . jared didn ’ t ask . ” “ oh , jess . ” i hugged her again and let her tears so ##ak through my shirt . somehow , my “ anything goes ” friend had managed to get seriously hurt and i couldn ’ t help but feel responsible . jess was always so flip ##pan ##t about hook ##ing up with guys that i hadn ’ t worried about her after the first night . she seemed so interested in him i didn ’ t see any reason to interfere . it wasn ’ t an excuse and i felt like an incredibly self - absorbed and horrible friend . “ you won ’ t hate me for leaving , will you ? ” jess appeared so vulnerable with her tear - streaked face .	1

since the stimulus cost was actually born by society the net effect on society was claimed to be positive . keynes ##ian economics had limited influence on the united states efforts to climb out of the great depression , though president roosevelt tried many programs hoping to provide such stimulation . the greatest impact of keynes ##ian theory , though , was to come in the latter half of the 20th century by the successors to the progressive mantle . the impact of fighting imagined mono ##pol ##ies among private business concerns has already been discussed . however , a paradox began to present itself as the federal government seemed to support real mono ##pol ##ies when it was in its best interests to do so . as already pointed out , president roosevelt ’ s national industrial recovery act ( ni ##ra ) was express ##ly aimed at organizing cartel ##s of private business to do the bidding of the federal government . that the federal government ’ s bidding was supposed to be better ##ing the collective national economy does not change the fact that it in effect violated existing anti - trust laws . actually it was worse than that .	she had to take pride in what little knowledge she had , or else spur ##n it altogether . “ the haze always has sa ##fra in it . they are both created , simultaneously , by something else .	1
stood , horrified , in front of the mirror . she had given margaret strict orders that the formal dress she was making was to be modest , and now she wondered if margaret needed to re - learn the word . she liked the material , and the way the long layers of soft fabric flowed when she moved . the top wasn ’ t too bad . a circle of pearls wrapped around her neck , and the upside - down ‘ v ’ of fabric draped from it did cover her , mostly . one problem was that it left her shoulders bare , and the sleeves , if that ’ s what you could call them , were split open all the way down and hung from her arms by small beads of pearls . the color was alright also . the top was dark blue , and it faded as it went to the floor , ending in white with what seemed to be runes stitch ##ed in contrasting blue thread . she turned to the side though and gasped . “ i ’ m coming to get you in 30 seconds , ” chevalier called out to her . she stepped out into her room and blushed . suddenly , she wasn ’ t sure she liked her hair piled elegant ##ly on her head with draped ring ##lets . she figured her hair would have hidden her body nicely . she felt uncomfortable when both chevalier and kyle looked at her and smiled . “ see , that ’ s not so bad , ” chevalier said , motion ##ing for the door . emily sighed and stepped toward the door , spinning when the two he ##ku started to laugh . “ i ’ m warning you . ” she eyed them . “ i ’ m sorry . it just took us by surprise , ” chevalier said .	he couldn ’ t tell from the front , but the top of the dress in its flat ##tering inverted ‘ v ’ shape left her back and sides completely uncovered . the back dropped dangerously low and accent ##uated her small waist , exposing down to just above her hips . he fought the desire to reach out and run his fingers along her delicate spine . he had to stay away from her tonight though . he couldn ’ t let the elders be suspicious . kyle glanced away nervously when he noticed that the revealing top also left the smallest portion of the outside of her breasts uncovered . he walked up beside her and held out his arm , which she took tim ##id ##ly and smiled at him . chevalier rep ##ressed the desire to remove kyle ’ s arm . they descended the steps and met the elders at the bottom . the two male elders were shocked at the sight of emily . they hadn ’ t imagined she would be so beautiful .	0

was the primary source of their problems ; it was his lead the others followed . he seemed to take pleasure in creating misery for others , as if their hardship ##s somehow made him more powerful . perhaps he acted that way to impress rose ##t and the other pretty girls from town , with their flowing dresses and lace - bound hair . either way , the friction was int ##ens ##ifying , and cat ##rin feared it would es ##cala ##te beyond control . anyone from the countryside was a target , but it was her friend os ##bourne mac ##ano , son of a pig farmer , who bore the br ##unt of their abuses . the low regard in which his family profession was held and his una ##ss ##uming manner made him an easy target . he had never fought back , and still the attacks continued . chase , cat ##rin ' s beloved cousin , felt they should stand up for themselves since passive resistance had proven fruit ##less . what choice did they have ? cat ##rin understood his motives , but to her , the problem seemed un ##sol ##vable . surely retaliation would not end the struggle , but neither had ina ##ction , which left her in a quan ##dar ##y . chase seemed to think they needed only to scare the town ##ies once to make them realize such treatment would not be tolerated . that , he said , was the only way to gain their respect , if not their friendship . she could see his logic , but she also saw other , less appealing possibilities , such as a swift and violent response or even expulsion from the school lessons . too many things could go wrong . chase was determined , though , and she would support him and os ##bourne in their fight , if that was their choice . but she did not have to like it . from br ##ib ##ing a woman who had once worked as pete ##n ' s nurse ##maid , chase learned that pete ##n had a terrible fear of snakes - - any snake , not just the venom ##ous varieties . chase planned to catch a snake and sneak it into the hall during lessons , though he admitted he had no plan for getting it near pete ##n	only such emotions rise in mind which have already been present in our sam ##ska ##rs . if there are no sam ##ska ##rs the consciousness flows uno ##bs ##truct ##ed and peacefully . this is the sub ##lim ##ated state of mind . the cause for assuming physical body drops along ##with the sub ##lim ##ation of mind and the soul realises the supreme soul . on reaching this stage the battle is complete and eternal victory is achieved . according to this view or angle of vision there can not be any loss if the living beings are killed .	1

chapter two no matter how many times dennis visited the office of doctor samuel harding , he always managed to get lost on the way there . allegedly , its placement in the fifteen - story building had remained unchanged during the duration of harding ’ s career , but dennis had always held the vague suspicion that it relocated when he wasn ’ t paying attention . still , his confusion upon looking at the building ’ s directory was always replaced by a sense of amused shock when he entered the office ’ s waiting room . harding had a strange habit of hanging large pictures , painted by his wife , on the far wall . although they were purported ##ly of the abstract variety , the ass ##em ##bla ##ges of shapes and colors always seemed to dennis to have vaguely sexual under ##tones . the current piece , for example , might very well have portrayed two obe ##se men playing leap ##fr ##og in the nude . there was no receptionist present , which was odd for harding , who to ##uted an un ##ri ##vale ##d hatred of telephone ##s and paperwork .	by god ’ s spirit gives us a map for the journey of life . dreams not interpreted can be likened to an un ##rea ##d letter . a repetitive dream signifies urgency and certainty . the more difficult a dream is ( to interpret ) , the more important it is to the dreamer . your spiritual level di ##cta ##tes how you see , react and interpret dreams . dreams that comes from a multitude of business ( i . e . to be involved with a thought or situation ) em ##ana ##tes from the individual ’ s being or soul ##7 ##2 . perception to perceive is to notice , become aware of or feel something , especially with the uses of the senses . it is to have an idea , a belief or an image as a result of what was seen , heard , tasted , touched , smelled , understood and or experienced . “ sir ##s i ( paul ) perceive ( or sense ) that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage … ” 73 - 79 this is to know , notice , be aware of , feel , and have an idea of or to have an image of the mind or thought of god on an issue through the five ( 5 ) senses , working together with our level of knowledge , understanding and experience of god . god does not expect us to be du ##mm ##ies . we should not be garbage in , garbage out . there are some instances where god expects us to use our senses , our knowledge , our understanding and experience which had been gained through many years of interaction and fellowship with him ; to disc ##ern and dec ##ip ##her his thoughts on	1

almost all of the prisoners with the ability that were sent to solitary confinement in the latter stages of their illness ended their own lives through various means . the months stretched out into years and de ##drick brown ' s slow deterioration into madness was documented with painful detail . after two years he was no longer co - operating in any capacity and was simply reduced to screaming inc ##oh ##ere ##ntly , and cursing the scientists who were studying him through the glass . it was after thirty - six months of study that de ##drick threw himself against the wall of his cell , smashing his skull and slump ##ing down in the corner , his body motionless .	observed as a pool of blood began to grow around the pathetic figure , but he didn ' t move . finally convinced he was dead , two scientists entered the room to begin the final study of de ##drick brown . as they approached , de ##drick ' s head shot up , a mani ##c grin di ##stor ##ting his face as blood o ##oz ##ed from his mouth and several broken teeth fell to the floor . before the third scientist , who was sitting in the observing station , had time to turn on the restrict ##ors , de ##drick had used his ability to twist the heads of the two scientists 180 ##° to face backwards , while he continued to sit on the floor in a pool of his own blood . his eyes flashed with delight and his years of desire to in ##flict pain and suffering on another human being were finally realised . the heads turned slowly as de ##drick re ##lish ##ed the moment , the distorted mechanics of his brain realising it would be his last chance enjoy such pleasure . the two scientists stood , screaming as their necks twisted and their spines cracked then split . when he was finished , de ##drick flicked his hand and the two dead bodies fell , lifeless , to the floor in front of him . the restrict ##ors were finally initial ##ised by the third scientist and de ##drick ' s ability was immediately disabled . the bodies were removed from the room and he was sent to the main prison , albeit in solitary confinement . the prison suffered huge embarrassment as a result of the research and were sued by the families of the two dead scientists . de ##drick brown spent his remaining year in the prison in berlin . he deteriorated further and after a few months he had very few motor skills remaining , and only occasional moments of luc ##idi ##ty . his final days were passed sitting in a chair and staring into space , saliva falling from his open mouth . the day before his brain finally relinquished control and his suffering was ended , one last curious item was documented in the de ##drick brown study	0

mark looked out the windshield . they were parked at the curb beside the road , under some large trees . to the right was the gate ##d driveway of a private estate and on the opposite side of the street was a park with brightly colored play equipment for children . “ ready , ma ##ury ? ” she said . “ yes , ” the driver answered . “ hold for bra ##cks . ” moran ##a put her phone to her ear and said , “ we ’ re ready for drop fifteen . do you have us ?	. ” she hung up her phone and opened a small compartment the size of a deck of playing cards on the wall of the truck . it blended in perfectly and mark would never have seen it . two switches were underneath it . she rested a finger on one of them . “ mark , please open the bay . ” mark got up and pulled back a mat that covered the truck ’ s chu ##te and grabbed two handles . last time he had seen a chu ##te , he had been lowered into it to escape the city . he swung the doors open and felt a sudden rush of nausea at what he saw . even though he knew what was under the doors , the sight still shook him . it was a woman in ragged clothing , lying face up , her eyes closed . her pale face was not con ##tort ##ed , but was calm , and she had a dvd hung around her neck like a necklace . “ thanks , ” moran ##a said . “ there ’ s no need for you to do anything more . you can have a seat — you look sick . ” “ i don ’ t feel well . ” toward the front of the truck she said , “ forward , ma ##ury . ” the truck ’ s engine labor ##ed in first gear as ma ##ury moved it as slowly as possible . moran ##a hit the switch and there was a hiss . the chu ##te ’ s bottom tilted , creating a ramp , and the woman ’ s body began to slide . when her head touched the ground , her body slid gently from the chu ##te and onto the pavement . moran ##a pressed the switch in the opposite direction and the chu ##te ’ s bottom retracted back into place . rather than having mark close it again , she stood and did it herself , closing the chu ##te ’ s doors and rolling the mat out on top of it again . as they drove away , mark peered out the back window . he saw the woman lying face - up beside the road just as she had in the chu ##te . cars approached in the distance and would soon pass the body .	0
public relations disaster just waiting to happen . lastly , we looked at the co ##s — war resist ##ers . hmm ##m . the nation ’ s at ##ti ##tu ##dina ##l tide hadn ’ t quite shifted yet but maybe the education director sensed something positive was happening in d . c . so after talking with the guys and weighing the pro ##s and con ##s , i recommended one of the minnesota 8 , charlie tu ##rch ##ick . chuck was a phi beta kappa in philosophy from the u of minnesota . he had played on the university ’ s table tennis team . more importantly , he was short ( i ’ m jeff and he ’ s mu ##tt in the group ) and very reserved — not your image of a scary convict . his demeanor , however , cloak ##ed one of the quick ##est minds and sharpe ##st tongues i ’ ve ever met — and been a target of !	, at the 11th hour , one week before the start date , the director turns to me and says , “ k ##ron ##cke , i want you to do this . ” me ? imposing at 6 ’ 3 ” and 235 in great shape . me ? the nonstop talk ##er , rebel preacher … oh , hell , i said , “ okay . ” as una ##nti ##ci ##pate ##d as anything i ’ ve told you yet is that i actually formed a personal bond with the principal . this was partly due to the john birch society . i am not making this up . as the semester was ending and the board of education was considering re - ce ##rti ##fying the project , my face once again was plastered under a headline story in the minneapolis tribune . the birch ##er national journal had recently published an article in which they highlighted this reading program and attacked me as an “ er ##st ##while revolutionary . ” the towns ##folk cr ##ammed into the board meeting . judgment : i was sainte ##d once again ! actually , my work was commended and the project re ##app ##roved .

red dirt music is basically home ##gr ##own texas country , just in case you never heard of it before . the kind of stuff local bands like to play on small - town summer evenings , mostly for love of music and home . there ’ s nothing better than a good red dirt band and some spicy beef barbecue at a friday night tail ##gate party , and a case of cold dr . pepper to wash it all down with . what ’ s not to love ? maybe i ’ m letting my southern country girl roots show , but hey , that ’ s who i am . “ yeah , sometimes we get paid a little bit , but we mostly play for tips . we have to take whatever we can get , pretty much . coffee houses , county fairs , things like that . sometimes even bars and hon ##ky - ton ##ks if that ’ s all we can find .	in my room , " marius replied . he had hidden it underneath his mattress . the ac ##ol ##yte ##s were supposed to check for ho ##arded food every night at lights out , but marius couldn ' t remember the last time they had actually done it . the fact that the office of souls ’ staff had grown so lazy around the soul ##less was a gift that marius was thankful for today . it made it that much easier to hide other things . " you didn ' t have any trouble , right ? " chi ##m asked . he looked over his shoulder as if expecting someone to pop out of the wall behind him . " no , " marius replied .

boy tee ##tering on the edge of adulthood , gabriel ? ” “ i remember the thoughts running through my head at a thousand miles an hour , ” gabriel said . “ i thought that i could never turn it all off , and it would drive me insane . ” “ ou ##i . like that exactly . and the dreams ? did you have the dreams ? ” gasp ##ard rumbled , “ dreams of death . dreams of flying like the hawk above us . dreams that we could understand each man ’ s inner ##most desires . so real . ” “ at eleven , i was so certain of a young ma ##ms ##elle ’ s love i went to her father to ask permission to marry her , ” added raoul . “ but it was all in my head . ” “ and we were but les petit ##s . little children unsure of our gifts , unsure what was real and what was a trick of the mind . ” sebastien turned to the gate once more . “ anna never had that period of learning where she had only to ask an elder for guidance . she had only herself , and who can say what she con ##jured in her mind . she will adjust or … ” “ or what ? ” gabriel ’ s voice was fierce . sebastien shrugged . “ she will adjust . ” “ you ’ ll look around the mine area ? ” said gabriel . he didn ’ t want to think of what would happen to anna if she couldn ’ t make the adjustment to the family . it was inc ##omp ##re ##hen ##sible . “ i will check the roads near the bluff and perhaps see if she went back to the garage . ” “ ou ##i , ” agreed sebastien . “ we will keep looking for her . just to make sure she hasn ’ t hurt herself . ” he hesitated before adding , “ there are sink ##holes near here , like the one which took her mother , treacherous quick ##san ##d . we must be quick . ” * * * gabriel was as tired as	chances are many of these people were like my mother , working twelve hours a day to support her family and make ends meet . they didn ’ t show up because they didn ’ t want to ; hey had obligations and just didn ’ t have the time . they wanted to be there and when they finally got a few days off from work , what did they do ? they showed up to church rather than stayed home and drag egg ##no ##g with rum in it . there was also a snow storm raging on outside so there was more than enough excuses not to show up , but this place was packed , standing room only .	1
later when the flights start running and the prices stab ##ilis ##e . ” raf ##ie ##e spoke in a heartbeat . it was typically him , putting me first . like in a love movie , i meant it when i gave him the choice , “ i ' m not leaving without you . it ’ s either we stay here and i flu ##nk the exam which is only a small price to pay , or we leave this place together . ” it was a difficult choice to make . on one hand , it was way too expensive just to get to the uk . you can make the same trip at one tenth of that . one tenth ! the irish hostel couldn ’ t ref ##und the first day ’ s stay because of the policy they had , even if the world had stopped going round . on the other , nobody knew when the sky would be clear . for all we knew , it could be days or even weeks . i had an exam in less than a week . raf ##ie ##e didn ’ t want me to take the risk . so we turned a blind eye to the price and booked a couple of t ##g ##v tickets ( train a grande vi ##tes ##se , or high - speed train for you non - french - speakers ) from nice to paris , the mega - price ##y euros ##tar train - crossing from paris to london and the night bus from london to newcastle . we were leaving after forty - eight hours of being stranded . it would be the most expensive 24 - hour trip we ’ d ever had and there wasn ’ t even any sights ##ee ##ing involved . we were told by our nico ##ise friends that we didn ’ t have to purchase the t ##g ##v tickets because ( naturally ) the french were on strike so nobody was checking anyone ’ s tickets . we didn ’ t want to break any rules , especially in a foreign country where we couldn ’ t use english to defend ourselves . after all the money spent booking the way out , we wanted to play as safe as possible . our main concern was that some trains were not even operating because of the strike . if the train wasn ’ t running , we were going to miss the next mega - price ##y train and bus and waste close to € ##70 ##0 , just to be back at square one . there was only one way to find out . the next morning , the train station was indeed un ##ru ##ly . we didn ’ t say a word at the time but we were both thinking the	“ look . i ’ ll take a torch and the shovel , go out and give the barn a quick scan .	1

god created a place out of love , where you can be free from the af ##flict ##ions that haunt you each day and most of all … a place where you can live with him , for all of eternity … a place where the sun never sets and life is lived without pain and heart ##ache . if you would like to know god and understand the full ##ness , of all he long ##s to offer you , in this life and the life to come , just pray … “ lord jesus , i ’ ve never met you before but i do long to know you now . i long for you to know my name ; that one day i may come and live a life with you , for all of eternity . please come into my heart , lord jesus , clean ##se me from all of my sins , and help me to live for you , instead of living for the world or myself . teach me your way , that we may connect and be as one for all of eternity … am ##en . ” as i close this book , i would like to share my heart with you . throughout many challenges , in my life , god has given me hope through a personal thought … a thought that came from his spirit to mine and i would like to share this with you too . in this thought or vision , i am walking down a pathway and the pathway does not seem to be too bad at first , until these boulders appear before me . some of the boulders in front of me are not quite as large as other boulders but for some reason , i feel that they all serve a purpose . as i continue to look through the rocky pathway that is before me , i see a glimpse of heaven and for some reason , i know that as long as i can remain focused on this beautiful place and the god who reigns over it , then i can keep pressing on . god never said that life would be easy , for any one of us . in fact , if life were too easy and perfect , then what purpose would we serve here on earth ? how would we gain god ’ s strength , if we already lived with perfect strength ? how would we learn to become people who pursue and keep pressing on , if god had everything fixed for us , from the start	if we plan to accomplish the things that are right for our lives , we need to be persistent and relay a message to god that says that we are not going to give in to our circumstances . we need to seek for the good things that will bring glory and honor to his name , while we travel these difficult pathways .	0

open . realizing i was now standing next to her , she grabbed my arm and tried to pull me back . she started to slam the door with her free hand , but i stopped her . “ cora , it ’ s okay , i know them , ” i said , recognizing the two people in front of us . “ riley and genevieve are the ones who saved me in the park . ” cora still had a tight grip on my arm and on the door knob . i opened the door all the way so we could see both of them on the porch . “ wow , you guys have a funny way of answering the door . how about a little gratitude ? ” genevieve said sarcastically . “ i ’ m sorry for scar ##ing you , cora , ” riley said . his irish accent was less obvious than last spring . i had never really gotten a good look at riley before . he was tall and slender . he reminded me of a greyhound with his narrow face and wi ##ry frame . genevieve looked like a movie star , dripping with sex appeal . her radiant skin was still lightly tanned . she was tiny but not like a little girl . her brown hair was pulled back in complex braid ##s . the nur ##turing way she had spoken to me in the park last year had been replaced by sarcasm , which sick ##ened me . “ my name is riley and this is genevieve . we are fellow thus ##ians like the two of you . we have been searching for you both for many years , cora . we caught up with you a year ago in tate ##sville , and we followed you here so we could watch after you both . luckily we did , because we were able to save nicholas . ” i looked over at cora . the light had returned to her eyes . she was the cora of old , vibrant and in control . she was in her protecting mode ; she had a purpose again — to keep me safe . the four of us just stood there in silence , waiting for the next person to make a move . cora wasn ’ t impressed by what riley was saying or willing to let them get any closer to me . she had somehow managed to get her foot in front of me just in case . “ maybe we could come in so we can talk , ”	she wasn ’ t going to let them into the house under any circumstances . “ cora , can we invite them in ? ” i asked , but it was like i wasn ’ t even there . riley tried this time . “ cora , you are right not to trust us , but please just give us a chance .	0

people avoid me because they think i ' m the local gay freak , but i have eyes and ears . the girls think they ' re safe from me , and the guys ignore me , so i can get fairly close to people .

it ' s almost comical to watch the undead things bite and snap at the birds only to take a bite out of the air . after a few minutes the zombies seem to forget all about the flying menace and go back to their staggering , wandering , aim ##less walking . then the hungry birds return , getting in a few choice peck ##s before the undead reacts all over again . i haven ' t actually seen a ze ##d returned to the grave because of the birds , bone is still bone and the birds can ' t peck their way into where it matters the most , the brain . some of the undead the birds have been feast ##ing on are nothing more than eye ##less , ivory skulls attached to a half eaten neck and well peck ##ed shoulders . dogs , on the other hand , are actually entertaining to watch . i viewed a pack of large , gaunt canine ##s stalking a handful of the living dead yesterday . the man ##gy , now feral , cu ##rs almost playfully surround their chosen victims first , running around excitedly among the undead that are completely unaware of what the dogs are about to do . once the pack is in position , there seems to be a silent signal that herald ##s the sudden attack upon the un ##sus ##pe ##cting parasite controlled cad ##aver ##s .	dogs picks out a ze ##d and jumps on it , knocking it down , usually from behind . once the ab ##omi ##nation is prone the other animals of the pack close in , jaws snapping , quickly ripping and tugging the un ##hol ##y thing into a limb ##less , sq ##ui ##rmin ##g torso . the dogs seem to pay very careful attention to the jaws of the undead . i ' m sure in their previous hunting they ' ve witnessed , first hand , the incredible strength with which the undead bite . none of the other undead in the vicinity seems to care that they lost one of their number just a few feet away . the pack repeats this behavior until their bell ##ies are full . i watched this one particular pack hunt and dev ##our three of the undead before they disappeared back into the ruins of the city . no matter how many scenes of horror or misery i ' ve seen , i often run across something more horrible than i would have imagined possible . every week at least , i come across something that sticks in my mind and def ##ile ##s my dreams forever . today , while exploring a modest , middle class home i found something that sends a chill running through me still . while i knew immediately there were undead in the house , i wasn ' t prepared for it . in an infants ' gail ##y decorated and painted bedroom was something	0

this or no wave runner , so get over it .
